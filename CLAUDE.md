# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in **quilltap-v5** — the next-generation
**native** Quilltap. This file is loaded every turn, so it stays short and points
at deeper docs. **The rules in "Standing rules" are not optional.**

## What this repo is

This is the ground-up native rewrite of Quilltap, currently a Next.js/React app
that lives in the separate **`quilltap-server`** repo (referred to here as **v4**;
its docs are mirrored under `docs/v4/`). v4 is the **reference oracle** — it
defines correct behavior. quilltap-v5 reimplements that behavior natively and is
checked against v4 mechanically (see "The differential port discipline").

**Target stack (decided June 2026):**

- **Core:** Rust. A portable engine (`quilltap-core`) holding the data layer,
  memory subsystem, job orchestration, and the single-writer invariant.
- **Frontend:** **Angular 21+** (zoneless, signals, standalone) — *not* React.
  Served as an SPA inside the Tauri webview.
- **Shell:** **Tauri 2** (desktop now; iOS/Android later via Tauri-mobile, with
  `uniffi`-generated Swift/Kotlin bindings over the same Rust core as the
  fallback path).
- **CLI:** a `quilltap` binary linking `quilltap-core` (first real consumer; v4's
  `npx quilltap` is its oracle).

Design docs (read before large changes), all under `docs/developer/porting/`:
`overview.md` (start here — methodology + phase roadmap + status),
`phase-0.md` (Phase-0 plan + the cipher finding), `api-boundary.md` (the
transport-agnostic boundary + the single-writer model + the enclave `step()`
seam), `phase-2-onramp.md` (the tier-2 DB-state oracle + fixtures — the next
build). The `docs/v4/` tree is the v4 reference mirror, not v5 planning.

## Standing rules (apply on every task)

### Spelling — non-negotiable

The project is **"Quilltap"** (quill + tap), **never** "Quilttap". Never write
"quilttap" anywhere.

### ⚠️ The database cipher is ChaCha20/sqleet, NOT SQLCipher

The single most expensive fact in this port. Every identifier in v4 says
"sqlcipher" (`ENCRYPTION_MASTER_PEPPER`, `sqlcipherKey`), and `docs/v4/.../
DATABASE_ENCRYPTION.md` *wrongly* claims SQLCipher — but v4 sets no `cipher=`
pragma, so it uses the default cipher of `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`:
**sqleet = ChaCha20-Poly1305**. Confirmed empirically (`PRAGMA cipher` →
`chacha20`).

- **Do NOT use `rusqlite` + `bundled-sqlcipher`** — it is AES-only and returns
  `NotADatabase` on every real Quilltap DB. (The retired `sqlcipher-probe` crate
  demonstrated this in Phase 0; don't reintroduce a bundled-sqlcipher feature.)
- The real DB layer links **SQLite3MultipleCiphers** (utelle), version matching
  what v4 bundles (**2.3.5**, on SQLite 3.53.2 in the matching amalgamation),
  opened with its default sqleet cipher — no `cipher=` pragma needed. The
  amalgamation is compiled by `crates/quilltap-core/build.rs` (vendored under
  `crates/quilltap-core/vendor/`) and linked as `sqlite3` for the whole
  workspace; the `db` module is the first consumer.
- **Two different ciphers — never conflate:** the `.dbkey` *file* wraps the
  pepper with **AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2** (that part of v4's docs is right; ported
  in `quilltap-core::dbkey`). The *databases* are **ChaCha20**.

### Opening a database (must match v4 byte-for-byte)

- Pepper → key via the **raw-hex form**: `PRAGMA key = "x'<hex>'"` (KDF skipped;
  we already derived via PBKDF2 when unwrapping `.dbkey`). The hex is
  `base64-decode(pepper) → hex`.
- `key` is the **first and only** pragma before the first read on a read-only
  open. **Do not** issue `journal_mode`/`foreign_keys` on a read path — mutating
  `journal_mode` on an existing encrypted file forces header writes that race the
  cipher context and surface as `NotADatabase`. (The writable path adds
  `foreign_keys = ON` + `journal_mode = TRUNCATE` — TRUNCATE not WAL, for
  cloud-sync safety, since instances live in iCloud/Dropbox.)

### The differential port discipline (the core methodology)

An AI-heavy port of a subtle system cannot be verified by inspection. **Every
ported unit arrives with an equivalence test against the v4 oracle.** Never
accept a port without one.

- **v4 is the oracle.** `harness/oracle/` runs from the v4 checkout
  (`npx tsx`), imports the **real** `lib/` code (never reimplements it), runs a
  fixed deterministic corpus, and emits NDJSON.
- **`quilltap-harness`** runs the same corpus through the Rust port and diffs
  field-by-field. Three tiers: (1) **exact** for pure functions (1e-12 for
  floats, exact for strings); (2) **structural DB diff** for repo/service ops
  (normalize legitimately-nondeterministic fields — timestamps, generated UUIDs
  via a remap, LLM text); (3) **mocked-LLM** for model-dependent paths (inject
  the same canned response both sides, then tier-2 on the writes).
- **Port leaf-to-root, pure-to-stateful.** Phase 1 pure functions → Phase 2 data
  layer → Phase 3 services/enclave → Phase 4 transports + Angular.
- **Small units.** One module/function per change, each independently
  oracle-checked. Carry forward v4's *why*-comments (the subtle invariants are
  what a port silently drops).
- **The schema does not change during the port.** Same tables, same UUIDs, same
  cipher. The Rust core opens the exact DB file v4 writes.

### Never accept unverified Rust

The sandbox has no Rust; Claude cannot compile here. **Do not present Rust as
done until the user has run `cargo build`/`cargo test` and confirmed.** Crypto
and cipher code especially: "looks right" is not good enough — the real-instance
open and the oracle diff are the proof. Flag version-specific crate API risks
explicitly.

### Architectural invariants to preserve from v4

- **Single writer.** v4's parent-is-sole-DB-writer rule (forked child + buffered
  writes over IPC) becomes, in Rust, a type/ownership rule: only the writer task
  holds the RW connection; a channel is the only mutator. **Keep** the
  correctness parts that aren't Node workarounds: per-database partitioned apply
  (main / mount-index / llm-logs, each its own transaction), main-primary vs
  idempotent ordering, the folder-conflict id remap.
- **Enclaves must not assume an always-on host.** Model an autonomous run as a
  persisted `step()` + `RunState` state machine with cadence injected by a
  per-host driver. iOS background limits (~30s windows) break overnight runs in
  *any* language — design for resume-on-open / optional companion server now.
- **Transport-agnostic boundary.** One `Request`/`Response`/`Event` contract;
  transports (Tauri IPC, uniffi, an axum HTTP shim for CI) are thin. No business
  logic above the boundary. Streaming only ever on the `Event` channel.

```

The two Phase-0 probe crates (`sqlcipher-probe`, `sqlite3mc-probe`) have been
retired: the real DB layer in `quilltap-core` now owns the amalgamation build,
and their findings are recorded here and in `docs/developer/porting/phase-0.md`.

## Working environment

- **Toolchain:** rustup, pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` (channel **1.96.0**).
  Don't paste the placeholder — use the real version. A `rust-toolchain.toml`
  is an *override file*: an invalid `channel` makes every `cargo` command in the
  tree fail.
- **Native build deps:** Xcode CLT (clang) + `cmake`. The DB build compiles the
  SQLite3MC amalgamation via the `cc` crate; `buildtime_bindgen` needs Clang.
- **`Cargo.lock` is committed** (this repo produces binaries). The `.gitignore`
  still lists it from the Phase-0 scaffold — that's inconsistent; prefer keeping
  the lock tracked and removing the ignore line.
- **macOS dev:** account for BSD tool variants; GNU coreutils/`gnu-sed` are
  installed under `g`-prefixed names.
- **Plan large changes with the most capable model; delegate well-specified
  subtasks to cheaper agents.** Don't use `git stash`/worktrees with agents.

## Running the differential harness

```bash
# 1. generate oracle output from the v4 checkout (imports real lib/ code)
cd ~/source/quilltap-server
npx tsx ~/source/quilltap-v5/harness/oracle/cases/memory-weighting.ts > /tmp/oracle-weighting.ndjson
npx tsx ~/source/quilltap-v5/harness/oracle/cases/ranking-blend.ts    > /tmp/oracle-ranking.ndjson

# 2. run the Rust diff (env vars point at the NDJSON; tests skip if unset)
cd ~/source/quilltap-v5
QT_ORACLE_WEIGHTING=/tmp/oracle-weighting.ndjson \
QT_ORACLE_RANKING=/tmp/oracle-ranking.ndjson \
  cargo test -p quilltap-harness
```

A standalone self-test (`now_constant_matches_iso`) guards the harness's own
fixed clock/date math against drift — run `cargo test -p quilltap-harness` with
no env vars to exercise it.

## Verifying / opening a real instance (Friday)

Friday lives at `~/iCloud/Quilltap/Friday`; DB files are in `data/`. To open a
**copy** (never the live file) from Rust, point `quilltap-core::dbkey` at the
data dir — it reads and decrypts `quilltap.dbkey` itself (no env var, no saved
pepper). iCloud may evict file contents to placeholders; if a copy opens with 0
tables, force-download the source (`brctl download …`) before copying. The pepper
is the master key to all data — never commit it, never write it where it syncs.

## Conventions

- **Writing voice:** user-facing strings (UI, help, prompts) keep v4's
  *steampunk + Roaring-20s + Wodehouse + Lemony Snicket* register. `CHANGELOG`
  is the exception — terse, plain American English.
- **Feature/personified-system names** carry over from v4 (the Salon, Aurora,
  Prospero, the Scriptorium, the Commonplace Book, the Lantern, the Concierge,
  Pascal, Carina, the Librarian, the Host, etc.). When porting a subsystem, keep
  its name and its `systemSender` semantics.
- **Character fields are four distinct vantage points** plus `manifesto` —
  identity / description / personality / title are **not interchangeable**;
  never collapse them. (Full definitions: `docs/v4/.../` and the v4 CLAUDE.md.)
- **Principles:** encapsulation, single source of truth, SRP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI.

## Hard stops (ask first)

- **No stubs or `TODO` code** unless agreed in advance.
- **Don't change the on-disk schema or cipher** during the port — it breaks the
  oracle comparison and existing instances.
- **Database writes against a real instance:** operate on a **copy**. Never point
  a writable open at live Friday data.
- **Don't initiate a release.** This repo's release process isn't established
  yet; set it up deliberately, don't improvise.

## Status (update as it moves)

**Phase 0 (scaffolding + differential harness): done.** Toolchain pinned;
monorepo skeleton; `.dbkey` decryption ported & verified; cipher resolved
(SQLite3MC/ChaCha20) and confirmed on real Friday data (37 tables, 33 chars,
20 320 memories); differential harness proven.

**Phase 1 (pure-function ports): in progress.** Each unit ships with a tier-1
exact-equivalence test against the v4 oracle. Ported so far: memory
weighting/ranking, recall tags + history, write-partition + folder remap,
context-compression sizing, enclave budget math, LLM pricing + model selection +
model classes, context-budget arithmetic, token estimation, the full turn manager (turn-state
machine, all-LLM auto-pause, participant-list filters, predicted turn order, and
weighted next-speaker selection with the RNG injected), the context-summary
cadence (fold/hard gate, interchange count, title-check crossing, turn
partition), the per-character context shaping (history-access gate, presence
windows, whisper visibility, role/name attribution), the pure memory
name-resolution leaves (reinforced-importance, name+pronoun formatting,
about/holder name-set builders, and the word-boundary name matchers —
`nameAppears`/`countNameOccurrences`/`resolveAboutCharacterId`, the Unicode
boundary + lookahead reproduced without a backtracking engine via the `regex`
crate plus a hand-rolled boundary check), the mentioned-character corpus scan
(`findMentionedCharacterIds` — ASCII `\b` alternation, longest-token-first), the
deterministic novel-detail extraction (`extractNovelDetails` — proper-noun /
date / currency / number-unit / CamelCase / acronym scan with ASCII `\d`/`\b`
and the JS `\s` set reproduced exactly), the chat-task artifact strippers
(`stripToolArtifacts` / `extractVisibleConversation` / `getCharacterChatPreview`,
over shared JS string primitives in `jsstr`), the embedding vector-math hot
paths (L2
normalisation, profile storage policy, cosine similarity + dimension-mismatch
guard, fallback keyword/phrase scorer, literal-phrase boost, Float32↔LE-byte
BLOB conversion, and the legacy JSON-text embedding recovery
[`parseLegacyEmbeddingText`, reproducing JS `Object.values` ascending
integer-key ordering]), the canon/scenario text helpers (self/other canon-block
rendering, the New-Chat scenario-text combiner), and a batch of small leaf
utilities (chat predicates, semver,
pronoun→gender, tag-style, char-count), and the JS number formatters (the
`Number.prototype.toFixed` kernel — V8 half-away-from-zero rounding on the exact
f64 value via IEEE-754 mantissa/exponent + u128 — and `formatBytes` /
`formatCostForDisplay` / `formatTokenCount` built on it), and the
`canonicalize*` tool serializers (deep code-unit key-sort of
`function.parameters` + the tool-name array sort, the latter a documented
`localeCompare` seam). **The collation/ordering wave is done:**
`parseLegacyEmbeddingText`, the `toFixed` formatters, `canonicalize*`, and
`compareVersions`' `localeCompare` fallback (documented as a residual seam — the
numeric path is exact). **The registry-seam wave is done:** the cheap-model
classifiers (`isCheapModel` / `estimateModelCost` / `getCheapestModel`, registry
recommended-list / default injected, string heuristics pure) and
`getModelContextLimit` (+ `hasExtendedContext` / `getSafeInputLimit`) — its
override/default tables ported as constants, the plugin model-info /
`FALLBACK_PRICING` rows / registry default injected. The single ICU-collation
decision (an `icu_collator`
/ `feruca`-class crate vs. the documented code-unit seam) is deliberately
deferred to when the ~30 Phase-2/3 `localeCompare` sites land, so it is made
once, holistically — the realistic version/tool-name corpora coincide with
code-unit order, so nothing shipped so far depends on it.

**Phase-2 on-ramp (tier-2 DB-state oracle): the pilot round-trips green.** The
`folders` repo now round-trips green through the tier-2 harness: both v4 and the
Rust port run the same create + update on the same seed fixture (synthetic,
test-pepper-keyed) and the canonical `folders` dumps match byte-for-byte (ids +
timestamps pinned both sides → zero normalization). This established the
machinery: `quilltap-core`'s `db` module (the writable ChaCha20 open + the
single-writer `Writer` + `FoldersRepository` create/update + canonical dump),
the amalgamation build relocated into core (probes retired), the TS oracle
(`harness/oracle/{fixtures,cases}/folders-tier2*`), and the harness diff test.
Remaining on-ramp breadth: ~~the generated-UUID remap / timestamp-placeholder
normalization~~ (**done** — see "the remap machinery" below), ~~the `WriteBatch`
partitioned-apply path~~ (**done** — see "the partitioned write applier" below),
and the real-snapshot fixture sanitizer. From here Phase 2 is the same mechanical
loop, repo by repo.

**Phase 2 proper: in progress.** Repos #5–#7 — `conversation_annotations`,
`provider_models`, and `help_docs` — were ported **in parallel** (three agents,
each on its own new files; the shared `db/mod.rs` wiring + version/doc edits
serialized afterward), and each round-trips green in the pinned
zero-normalization form (`conversation_annotations_tier2_equivalence`,
`provider_models_tier2_equivalence`, `help_docs_tier2_equivalence`). They bank
three still-unverified marshaling shapes: `conversation_annotations` a
**REAL-affinity unbounded-int column** (`messageIndex` is
`z.number().int().min(0)` with no `.max()` → REAL by v4's `mapToSQLiteType`,
bound `f64`, the integer-valued cell collapsed back by `js_number_to_json`) plus
a nullable UUID column; `provider_models` two **nullable REAL number columns**
(`contextWindow` / `maxOutputTokens`, bare `z.number()` → REAL), two
boolean-default columns, and enum TEXT columns; and `help_docs` the **first
tier-2 BLOB column** (`embedding`, Float32 little-endian bytes via
`embedding_blob::float32_to_blob`, empty/null → NULL, dumped as hex for bit-exact
compare — and proving a text-only `update` leaves the BLOB untouched). The
distinctive `upsert*` methods on these three are deferred (their internal
`now`/`generateId()` needs the remap-normalization form, not the pinned form).

Repo #4, `prompt_templates`
(`quilltap-core::db::prompt_templates`), round-trips green
(`prompt_templates_tier2_equivalence`): `create` + `update` + `delete` from v4's
`PromptTemplatesRepository` (built-in seeding out of scope). Banks the **first
JSON array column** (`tags` → compact JSON text via `serde_json::to_string` of a
`Vec<String>`; arrays are order-preserving, so no key-order subtlety like the
`tags.visualStyle` object) and several **nullable string columns** (`userId`
null-for-built-in, `description`, `category`, `modelHint`). Adds the **built-in
read-only guard** — `update`/`delete` read the target's `isBuiltIn` and refuse to
mutate a built-in row, returning a not-modified result (`Ok(false)`; v4's `null`
/ `false`) rather than throwing. The harness exercises the guard two ways via an
`expectNoop` flag (a built-in-targeted update and delete), proving both sides
report not-modified on top of the byte-identical dump. Ids + timestamps pinned →
zero normalization.

Repo #3, `text_replacement_rules`
(`quilltap-core::db::text_replacement_rules`), round-trips green
(`text_replacement_rules_tier2_equivalence`): `create` + `update` + `delete` from
v4's `TextReplacementRulesRepository`. It is the **first repo with conflict
detection**, and so the first to need a repo-level *read*: `create`/`update` scan
existing rows and reject a duplicate `(fromText, caseSensitive)` pair
(`TrrError::Conflict`, the analogue of v4's `TextReplacementRuleConflictError` →
HTTP 409; case-sensitive compares exactly, case-insensitive lowercased, the flag
is part of the key, `update` re-checks only when the pair changes). It widens
marshaling again — a real INTEGER number column (`sortOrder`) and two boolean
columns (`caseSensitive`/`enabled`, the latter read back for the check). The
harness corpus exercises the conflict path two ways (a conflicting create and a
conflicting update), each flagged `expectThrow` so both sides independently prove
the rejection (oracle: v4 threw; Rust: `TrrError::Conflict`) on top of the
final-state dump diff. Ids + timestamps pinned → zero normalization. This added
the canonical-dump `js_number_to_json` refinement (an integer-valued REAL cell
renders as a JSON integer, mirroring JS `JSON.stringify`, so REAL-affinity numeric
columns align byte-for-byte). It gives the `toLowerCase` case-mapping deferral a
**second site** (the case-insensitive conflict branch) — see "Deferred seams —
must revisit" in `docs/developer/porting/phase-2-onramp.md`.

Repo #2, `tags` (`quilltap-core::db::tags`),
round-trips green through the tier-2 harness (`tags_tier2_equivalence`): `create`
+ `update` + `delete` ported from v4's `TagsRepository`. It widens the marshaling
surface past `folders`' all-strings shape — the `quickHide` boolean stored as
INTEGER 0/1, the nullable `visualStyle` JSON-object column stored as compact JSON
in schema field order (reproduced with a typed struct so key order matches v4's
`JSON.stringify`, **not** a sorted `serde_json::Value`), and the `nameLower`
derivation (`(nameLower || name).toLowerCase()` on create, re-derived from `name`
on update) — and adds the `delete` op to the harness. Determinism unchanged: ids
+ timestamps pinned both sides → zero normalization. It introduces a **distinct,
tracked deferral**: JS-vs-Rust Unicode **case mapping** for `nameLower`
(`toLowerCase` vs `to_lowercase`) — a *separate* decision from the ICU
`localeCompare` (collation) one, since resolving collation does not resolve case
mapping. It's a real correctness risk on non-ASCII names (it backs `findByName`),
masked only by the ASCII corpus. Both deferrals are listed under "Deferred seams
— must revisit" in `docs/developer/porting/phase-2-onramp.md`; close them before
running against real (non-ASCII) data.

**The remap machinery (minted-values tier-2): done.** The on-ramp's
generated-UUID remap + timestamp-placeholder normalization is built and green
(`folders_remap_tier2_equivalence`). `folders.create` now ports v4 `_create`'s
minted defaults (`id = options?.id || generateId()`, timestamps `|| now`) and
returns the id used; `quilltap-core::clock` (`now_iso` / pure
`iso_from_unix_ms`) reproduces `new Date().toISOString()`, and `uuid` mints v4
ids. The test creates a parent + child with NOTHING pinned (both sides mint
different random UUIDs + clocks), then one normalization (in the harness, over
both dumps) walks rows in natural-key order, collapses id columns (`id`,
`parentFolderId`) to first-seen tokens — so the child→parent FK is verified
without pinning literal ids — and placeholders timestamps after asserting the
per-row `createdAt == updatedAt` invariant. This is the normalization form for
the repos/ops that can't take injected ids/clocks; the pinned zero-normalization
form (`folders` / `tags`) remains preferred where the op allows it.

**The partitioned write applier: done.** `quilltap-core::write_apply` ports v4's
`applyWritesUnsafe` quartet — the writer-task apply path that sequences the pure
`write_partition` leaves into real orchestration: each partition (main /
mount-index / llm-logs) in its own `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction; main-primary
(`AUTONOMOUS_ROOM_TURN`) commits main first then secondaries best-effort, while
idempotent jobs apply secondaries first so a secondary failure blocks the main
commit; plus the concurrent `docMountFolders.create` unique-conflict reconcile +
folder-id remap. The engine is generic over an injected `ApplyHost` (the three
connections + repo dispatch + reconcile lookup) — the same orchestration-vs-rows
split v4 uses (it unit-tests the applier with fake DBs + recording repos; the row
writes go through repos, each tier-2-verified separately). So the differential is
**tier-1-style trace equivalence**, not tier-2: `write_apply_equivalence` runs a
committed 9-scenario corpus through both the Rust engine and v4's REAL
`applyWritesUnsafe`, diffing the observable trace (per-partition exec sequence,
ordered dispatches with post-remap args, reconcile lookups, resolved/threw). That
oracle (`harness/oracle/cases/write-apply.test.ts`) runs under **v4's jest**, not
tsx — the applier's `getRawDatabase()`/`getRepositories()` singletons are
`jest.mock`-injected; v4's jest picks up the v5-tree oracle file via an extra
`--roots`. Deferred (documented in the module + phase-2-onramp): `__finalizeFile`
(fs rename + undo-on-rollback) and the post-commit side effects
(`cleanupStagingDirs` / `dispatchInvalidations`).
