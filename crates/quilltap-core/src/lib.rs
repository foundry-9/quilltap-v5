//! quilltap-core — the portable engine.

//! Phase-0/1 surface is small and growing:
//!   * `dbkey` — recovers the master pepper from the on-disk `quilltap.dbkey`
//!     file (AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2). NB: this unwraps the FILE; the DATABASES
//!     themselves are ChaCha20/sqleet, not SQLCipher — see CLAUDE.md.
//!   * `memory_weighting` — pure scoring functions ported from v4 and verified
//!     against the differential oracle.
//! Everything else (repos, services, the Request/Response/Event boundary)
//! lands in later phases.
