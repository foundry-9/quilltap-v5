# Uploading Files

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/files)**

Learn how to upload files to Quilltap for use in projects, chats, and character profiles.

## File Upload Overview

Uploading files to Quilltap allows you to:

- Store files in your general file library
- Use files in character profiles (images)
- Attach files to chat messages
- Create folders and organize content
- Give the AI access to files for analysis and processing

## Where You Can Upload

### General Files Page

Upload to your general file library (accessible in any chat):

1. Click **Files** in the sidebar
2. Navigate to desired folder (or stay in root)
3. Click **Upload** button
4. Select file(s) from your computer
5. Files upload to current folder

### In a Chat

Attach files to individual messages:

1. In chat composer, look for **+ Attach** or **📎** icon
2. Click to select file(s)
3. Files appear as attachments below the message
4. Send message with attachments

**After sending:**

- Attachments shown in message
- Can be downloaded from chat
- Can be promoted to permanent files

**A word on pictures.** An image attached to a chat is quietly shown to a
describing model shortly after it lands (see [Chat Settings](chat-settings.md)),
and the description is filed in three places: on the file's own record, on
every shelf in the [Scriptorium](scriptorium.md) where those same bytes appear,
and in the search index — so *"the photograph of the kettle on the windowsill"*
finds the picture later even though a picture holds no words. Until 4.9.0 only
the first of the three was reached for any bitmap the house converted to WebP
on its way in, which was rather a lot of them; converted uploads made before
that release are repaired on first start.

**A word on company.** When several characters share a room, an attachment is
put before *each* of them in turn, and not merely before whoever happens to
speak first. Until 4.9.0 the file was unrolled for the opening reply and then,
with the quiet finality of a butler clearing a plate, taken away again — so the
second character to speak, and every character on every later turn, was left
holding your typed words and an empty gesture toward a document nobody would
show them. The attachment clip in the transcript said otherwise, which is the
sort of thing that makes a perfectly honest companion look forgetful, and a
less scrupulous one look inventive. The file is now re-read from the shelf for
each character who has not yet been shown it — once apiece, not once a turn,
since even the most engrossing transcript wears out its welcome on the fourth
reading — and this holds for pictures exactly as it does for prose.

### Character Profiles

Upload images for character profiles:

1. Go to **Characters**
2. Create or edit a character
3. Look for **Add Profile Picture** or **Upload Avatar**
4. Click to select image file
5. Image set as character profile picture

### Speeding Up Uploads

**For slow uploads:**

## Organizing During Upload

### Creating Folders Before Upload

**Recommended workflow:**

1. Go to Files page
2. Create folder structure you want
3. Navigate to first folder
4. Upload files for that folder
5. Navigate to next folder
6. Upload files for that folder

**Example:** Create `/Research/` folder first, then upload research documents into it

### Sorting Into Folders

**After uploading:**

1. Upload everything to root first
2. Create folder structure
3. Use Move operation to sort into folders
4. Or manually move each file

**Advantage:** Don't worry about folder during upload, organize after

## Tips for Better File Uploads

### Naming Files

**Good names:**

- Descriptive and clear
- Use dates for versions: `2025-01-31-proposal.docx`
- Include file type in name: `budget-2025.xlsx`
- Avoid spaces if possible: `use-hyphens-or_underscores`

**Poor names:**

- `file.txt` (not descriptive)
- `Document 1.pdf` (vague)
- `FINAL_v3_UPDATED_REAL (1).docx` (version tracking)

### Using Descriptions

Add descriptions when available:

1. After uploading, right-click file
2. Click **Edit Details** or **Add Description**
3. Write what the file contains
4. Descriptions visible in search and hover

### Batch Organization

**Upload many files:**

1. Create all folders first
2. Upload all files to root
3. Sort into folders (use move/rename)
4. Add descriptions in batch if possible

**Saves time vs. uploading to individual folders**

### Backup Important Files

**Before uploading:**

- Keep backup on your computer
- Important files should be in version control (Git)
- Critical data should be backed up externally

**After uploading:**

- Quilltap stores safely
- Download periodically for backup
- Use The Forge > File Storage to backup entire library
