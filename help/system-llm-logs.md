# LLM Logs

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/settings?tab=system&section=llm-logs)**

The LLM Logs tool shows detailed records of all AI model interactions and API calls in your Quilltap system.

## What Are LLM Logs?

LLM Logs record every interaction with Large Language Models (AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Each log entry contains:

**For each API call:**

- Which provider was used (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Which model was called (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Messages sent to the model
- Model's response
- Tokens used (input and output)
- Estimated cost in USD
- Timestamp of the call
- Success or failure status
- Any error messages

**Why this matters:**

- Troubleshoot AI responses
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Track API errors
- Audit AI interactions
- Understand conversation flow

## The LLM Inspector Panel

The **LLM Inspector** is a slide-over panel available directly from the chat view, rather like having a clerk's ledger open beside your writing desk. It shows every LLM interaction associated with a conversation in neat chronological order.

### Opening the Inspector

There are three ways to summon the Inspector:

1. **Toolbar button** - Click the terminal icon in the chat toolbar (top-right corner, beside the cost summary if enabled)
2. **Keyboard shortcut** - Press **Cmd+Shift+L** (macOS) or **Ctrl+Shift+L** (Windows/Linux)
3. **Per-message button** - Click "View LLM logs" on any assistant message that has associated logs; the Inspector will open scrolled directly to that entry

The toolbar button and keyboard shortcut are only available when LLM logging is enabled in your Chat Settings.

### What the Inspector Shows

Each entry in the Inspector displays:

- **Timestamp** - When the API call was made
- **Type badge** - Color-coded by operation type:
  - **Chat / Tool** (primary color) - Direct chat messages and tool continuations
  - **Memory** (info blue) - Memory extraction operations
  - **Title / Summary / Compress** (secondary) - Background system operations
  - **Image** (warning amber) - Image prompt crafting, description, appearance resolution
  - **Safety** (red) - Dangerous content classification
  - **Wizard / Import** (green) - Character wizard and AI import operations
- **Provider/Model** - Which AI service and model handled the request
- **Token summary** - Input tokens and output tokens at a glance
- **Duration** - How long the API call took
- **Error indicator** - A red icon if the request failed

### Expanding an Entry

Click any entry to expand it into a tabbed detail view:

- **Request** tab - Provider info, message count, temperature, max tokens, tool count, and a summary of each message sent to the model
- **Response** tab - Success/error status and content preview (with full content if verbose logging is enabled)
- **Usage** tab - Token breakdown (prompt, completion, total), cache usage if applicable, and timing information

### Filtering Entries

Use the filter dropdown in the Inspector header to narrow down what you see:

- **All** - Every log entry
- **Chat Messages** - Direct chat and tool continuation calls
- **Memory** - Memory extraction operations
- **System Ops** - Title generation, summarization, context compression
- **Image** - Image-related operations
- **Safety** - Dangerous content classification
- **Other** - Character wizard, AI import

### Live Updates

After you send a message and receive a response, the Inspector automatically refreshes to include the new log entries. You can also click the refresh button in the header at any time.

## Accessing LLM Logs from Settings

**Go to the **Data & System** tab in Settings** (`/settings?tab=system&section=llm-logs`) and expand the **LLM Logs** card.

The card shows:

- List of recent LLM logs (typically last 20 calls)
- Most recent logs at the top
- Quick overview of provider and model
- Timestamp of each call
- Status indicator (success/error)

## Understanding Log Information

### For Each Log Entry

**Provider**

- The AI service that was called
- Examples: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.
- Indicates which API was used

**Model**

- Specific model name used
- Examples: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Claude-3-opus, etc.
- Different models have different capabilities and costs

**Timestamp**

- When the API call was made
- Shows date and time
- Helps identify when issues occurred

**Tokens Used**

- Input tokens: Tokens sent to the model
- Output tokens: Tokens in the model's response
- Displayed as "Input: X | Output: Y"

**Estimated Cost**

- Cost in USD for this single API call
- Based on provider's pricing
- Helps track expenses

**Status**

- **Success** - API call completed normally
- **Error** - API call failed
- **Partial** - Call succeeded but with warnings

### Viewing Detailed Logs

**Click on a log entry** to see full details:

- Complete prompt/messages sent to model
- Full response from model
- Token breakdown
- Error details (if failed)
- API response metadata
- Latency/timing information

**Details view allows:**

- Reading full conversation with model
- Understanding what model was asked
- Seeing exactly what model responded with
- Reviewing error messages
- Checking token counts

## Using Logs for Troubleshooting

### When AI Response Seems Wrong

1. **Open the LLM Inspector** from the chat toolbar
2. **Find the relevant log entry** (by timestamp and type badge)
3. **Expand it** to view full details
4. **Check what was sent to model** - Was the prompt correct?
5. **Review model's response** - What exactly did it return?
6. **Identify the issue:**
   - Was prompt clear?
   - Did model misunderstand?
   - Was model constrained by token limit?
   - Did system prompt affect response?

### When API Calls Fail

1. **Look for entries with error indicators** (red circle icon)
2. **Expand to view details**
3. **Read error message** from provider
4. **Common errors:**
   - **Rate limit exceeded:** Too many calls too fast
   - **Invalid API key:** Authentication failed
   - **Model not available:** Model is disabled or restricted
   - **Context too long:** Message exceeded token limit
   - **Network error:** Connection issue

### When Costs Are Higher Than Expected

1. **Check token counts** in the Usage tab
2. **Identify heavy-token-usage calls**
3. **Look for patterns** - What types of calls use most tokens?
4. **Review message history** - Long conversations use more tokens
5. **Consider switching to cheaper model** if high costs are an issue

## Monitoring Token Usage

### Understanding Tokens

**Tokens** are the basic units that AI models process:

- Roughly 4 characters = 1 token
- Large documents = many tokens
- Cost is charged per token

**Token usage breakdown:**

- **Input tokens:** What you send to the model (higher count = more cost)
- **Output tokens:** What model sends back (often more expensive per token)

**Estimating tokens:**

- 1 word ≈ 1.3 tokens
- 100 characters ≈ 25 tokens
- English text ≈ 1 token per 4 characters

### Tracking Costs

**Each log shows estimated cost:**

- Cost per API call
- Based on provider's token pricing
- Different models have different rates
- Add up costs to track total spending

**Tips for cost management:**

- Monitor which models use most tokens
- Consider using cheaper models for simple tasks
- Keep prompts concise
- Delete old chat histories to avoid reprocessing

## Log Retention & Storage

**How long logs are kept:**

- Configurable in Chat Settings (default: 30 days)
- Older logs are automatically cleaned up
- Set retention to 0 for indefinite storage

**Log storage:**

- Logs stored in a separate SQLite database (`quilltap-llm-logs.db`)
- Isolated from your main data for performance
- Gracefully degrades if the log database has issues

## Filtering and Searching Logs

**In the Inspector panel, you can:**

- Filter by category (Chat, Memory, System, Image, Safety, Other)
- See entry counts for the current filter
- Refresh to see latest entries
- Scroll to specific message-linked entries

**In the Settings page, you can:**

- View recent logs across all chats
- Filter by provider or model
- Sort by timestamp

## Common Patterns in Logs

**Successful conversation:**

- Multiple logs with success status
- Increasing token counts (longer history)
- Consistent model usage
- Costs accumulate with each call

**Error pattern:**

- Failed logs grouped together
- Same error repeated
- Often rate limit or authentication errors
- May indicate API issue

**Model switching:**

- Different models used over time
- Cost variations between models
- Token efficiency differences
- Provider changes

## Privacy & Security

**What's in logs:**

- AI prompts and responses
- May contain user input data
- Chat message content
- System instructions

**Log security:**

- Logs are server-side (not exposed to client logs)
- Only accessible to you and admins
- Not transmitted elsewhere
- Encrypted in transit and at rest

**Viewing logs safely:**

- Only you can access your logs
- Support team can view with permission
- Logs are kept confidential
- You can request log deletion

## Troubleshooting

**Can't see my logs**

- Refresh the page
- Very recent calls may not appear immediately
- Old logs may be archived
- Contact support if missing logs

**Inspector button not visible**

- LLM logging may be disabled in Chat Settings
- Enable it in Settings > Chat tab > LLM Logging

**Log seems incomplete**

- Some logs are truncated for display
- Click to expand and view full details
- Enable "Verbose Mode" in Chat Settings for complete message content

**Wrong information in log**

- Logs record exactly what was sent/received
- Review original request
- Check if issue is with model response
- Contact support if data corruption suspected

**Cost tracking seems off**

- Verify token counts are accurate
- Check if multiple API calls were made
- Compare with provider's billing
- Contact support for cost verification

## Best Practices

**Regular Review:**

- Check logs periodically for patterns
- Monitor token usage trends
- Track cost over time
- Identify problematic queries

**Troubleshooting:**

- Always check logs when issues occur
- Full details help identify problems
- Share relevant logs with support
- Compare successful vs. failed patterns

**Cost Management:**

- Review high-cost calls regularly
- Identify which tasks use most tokens
- Consider model optimization
- Plan for capacity needs

**Monitoring:**

- Watch for error patterns
- Alert on rate limit errors
- Track model changes
- Document API changes
