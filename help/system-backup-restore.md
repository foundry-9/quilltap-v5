# Backup & Restore

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/settings?tab=system&section=backup-restore)**

The Backup & Restore tool lets you create complete backups of your Quilltap system and restore from previous backups.

## What Gets Backed Up?

A complete backup includes everything needed to recreate your Quilltap environment:

**Your Content**
- All characters and their configurations
- Per-character plugin data (such as Commonplace Book entries stored by plugins)
- All chat histories and messages
- Conversation annotations (marginal notes added during roleplay sessions)
- All memories and memory data
- All files you've uploaded (images, documents, attachments)
- All folder structures you've created
- Projects and their settings
- Character groups — the whole fellowship preserved intact: each group's roster of members, its description and instructions, its scenarios and linked knowledge stores. (Time was, a restored archive returned your characters as so many strangers, every association between them quietly mislaid; that oversight has been set right, and a group now travels with its membership and its stores entire.)
- Wardrobe items — every garment, every composite outfit, and the dressing instructions a wardrobe may keep for a character who dresses themselves
- Your document stores entire (the Scriptorium): the mount points, their folders and files, the text of every document, and the pictures and PDFs kept alongside. This is the trunk a great deal of your work travels in — a character's vault, a project's papers, its scenarios and its wardrobe are all documents in a store, and they are packed with it.

**Profiles & Settings**
- Connection profiles (API key references — keys need re-entry after restore)
- Image generation profiles
- Embedding profiles
- Chat display and behavior settings
- Text replacement rules — your private lexicon of find-and-replace substitutions, packed up whole. (Time was, only the switch that governs them made the journey, leaving you to restore a tidy ledger of *nothing*; that small injustice has been put right, and the rules themselves now travel alongside.)
- File write permissions (LLM file access grants)
- Plugin configurations (per-plugin settings)

**Templates & Organization**
- Prompt templates (user-created)
- Roleplay templates (user-created)
- Tags and organizational data

**Plugins**
- npm-installed plugins from your `plugins/npm/` directory
- Plugin-specific configurations

**Themes**
- User-installed theme bundles (themes you have installed from registries or manually)
- Built-in bundled themes are not included as they ship with the application

**Logs & History**
- LLM request/response logs (the Inspector's records)

**Not Included in Backups**

Certain data is intentionally excluded from backups:

- **API keys** — encrypted with device-specific keys and cannot be transferred between instances. You will need to re-enter your API keys in your connection, image, and embedding profiles after a restore.
- **Encryption key (`data/quilltap.dbkey`)** — the master encryption key for your database is not included for security. Keep that file backed up separately if you use database encryption, and mind the `data/` subdirectory when you copy it.
- **Nothing about your search indexes, ordinarily** — a full backup carries every embedding and search index intact, so semantic search is working the moment a restore finishes. This is precisely why a backup is not the same article as a portable `.qtap` export, which leaves embeddings behind on purpose. Tick **Compact backup** and the indexes are the one thing left out; see below.
- **Background jobs** — any in-flight or queued tasks (embedding generation, memory extraction, etc.) are not preserved. They will be re-triggered as needed.
- **Built-in plugins** — these ship with Quilltap and do not need backing up.
- **The help pages you are reading** — they ship with the application and are re-read from disk whenever a page changes, so an archived copy could only hold you to yesterday's wording. Their search index is rebuilt with them.
- **Cached provider model lists** — while included in backups for convenience, these are refreshed automatically from your providers.

## Creating a Backup

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Go to the **AI Providers** tab in Settings** (`/settings?tab=providers`)

2. **Find the Backup & Restore card**

3. **Decide whether you want a compact backup**
   - Leave the **Compact backup** box unticked for the full article, which is
     the recommendation and the default
   - Tick it for a considerably slimmer archive, at the cost described below

4. **Click the "Create Backup" button**

5. **Wait for the backup to be created**
   - A progress indicator may be displayed
   - Time depends on amount of data

6. **Download the backup file**
   - Your browser will download a ZIP file
   - The file contains all your data

7. **Store the backup safely**
   - Save it to a secure location on your computer
   - Consider cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) for redundancy

**Backup sizes:**

- Varies based on your data volume
- Typically 10 MB - 1 GB depending on number of characters, chats, and files
- Backups are compressed to save space

### The Compact Backup

Search indexes are, by weight, the overwhelming majority of a well-used
archive — a great silent ballast of numbers beneath a comparatively modest cargo
of actual prose. A **compact backup** declines to carry them.

**What is left behind:** every embedding vector and every table derived from
one — conversation chunks, vector indexes, TF-IDF vocabularies, indexing status,
and document-store chunks.

**What is emphatically *not* left behind:** anything you wrote. Characters,
chats, messages, memories, files, settings, and all the rest travel exactly as
they do in a full backup. Only the machinery of *finding* things quickly is
omitted, and that machinery is rebuilt from the words themselves.

**On restoring one**, Quilltap notices the archive is compact and queues a full
re-indexing pass at once. Everything is readable immediately; semantic search
warms back up as the Tasks Queue drains. Conversation and document chunks are
rebuilt as those chats and stores are next opened.

**Which should you choose?** The full backup, nearly always. A backup exists to
restore *this* instance, where the indexes are still perfectly valid on arrival,
and rebuilding them costs real time and — with a paid embedding provider — real
money, at precisely the moment you are recovering from a misfortune and least
want either. Reach for compact when the size of the archive is itself the
problem: a thin pipe, a full disc, a mail attachment that will not have it.

## Restoring from a Backup

**Important:** Restoring can either replace your current data or import alongside it.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Go to the **AI Providers** tab in Settings** (`/settings?tab=providers`)

2. **Find the Backup & Restore card**

3. **Click "Restore from Backup"**

4. **Select your backup file**
   - Click to browse or drag and drop
   - Supports .zip backup files

5. **Preview the backup contents**
   - See what's included (characters, chats, files, etc.)
   - Review the counts before proceeding

6. **Choose restore mode:**
   - **Replace Existing Data:** Delete all current data and replace with backup
   - **Import as New Data:** Keep existing data and import backup with new IDs

7. **Confirm and start restore**
   - For "Replace" mode, you must confirm the deletion warning
   - "Replace" mode also offers to spare archived-character bundles from the
     preceding wipe (ticked by default — see "Replace Mode and the Archive
     Shelf" below)
   - Click "Start Restore"

8. **Wait for restore to complete**
   - System will show progress
   - Do not close the browser tab

9. **Restore complete**
   - Your system reloads with the restored data
   - npm plugins are extracted and ready to use
   - The restore summary may mention re-indexing; see below

## After a Restore: The Indexing Sweep

Every restore now ends with a brief inspection of the search indexes it has just
laid down, and this is not idle ceremony. An archive made on one machine can
land on another that keeps a different embedding profile entirely — or be
restored in "Import as New Data" mode, which is much the same situation wearing
a different hat. Vectors made under one standard mean nothing under another, and
until now the mismatch went unnoticed until the *following* startup.

Three outcomes, all reported in the restore summary:

- **Nothing to do.** The indexes match this instance's profile. This is the
  ordinary case for restoring a backup onto the machine that made it, and it
  costs essentially nothing.
- **Re-indexing queued.** Some indexes did not match and have been sent for
  repair. Everything is readable at once; semantic search warms up as the Tasks
  Queue drains.
- **Inspection skipped.** No embedding profile is configured yet, or it is the
  built-in one, which keeps no fixed measure. The next startup will look again.

A compact backup always takes the second road, by design — it brought no indexes
to inspect.

## Restoring an Older Backup

An archive is a photograph of an evening, and it can only show what was in the
room at the time. A backup made before some setting existed carries no opinion
about it, and Quilltap must decide what such a silence means.

It now decides the way it decides on an upgrade: by asking what the profile
*would* have been given, rather than by taking whatever value happens to sit at
the head of the column. Two settings on your connection profiles are in this
position, and both used to come back wrong.

- **Announce the speaker in multi-character scenes.** An archive older than the
  checkbox returns with the matter left open, so the provider's own good sense
  settles it — unticked for Anthropic, which refuses the `[Name]` prefill
  outright, ticked elsewhere. Previously such a profile came back with the box
  ticked regardless, and an Anthropic profile so restored would decline every
  turn in a crowded room until you found the box yourself.
- **Supports image attachments.** An archive older than *that* checkbox returns
  with the capability its provider had in those days, rather than with the
  capability switched off across the board.

A setting the archive *does* carry is never second-guessed, and this holds
whether the data arrives as a backup or as a `.qtap` bundle — the two doors now
open onto the same room.

## Restore Modes Explained

**Replace Existing Data:**
- Deletes ALL your current data
- Replaces it entirely with the backup contents
- Use when migrating to a new instance
- Use when recovering from data corruption
- Cannot be undone

**Import as New Data:**
- Keeps all your existing data
- Imports backup contents with regenerated IDs
- Use to merge data from another instance
- Use to duplicate content for testing
- Existing data remains untouched

## Replace Mode and the Archive Shelf

A "Replace" restore begins by clearing out your current data, and archived
characters' encrypted `.qtap` bundles would ordinarily be swept out with it.
The mode step therefore offers a checkbox — **ticked by default** — to leave
those bundles on the shelf while the wipe proceeds.

What survives is the bundle *file* alone. The archived character's record is
replaced along with everything else by the backup's contents, so a spared
bundle cannot simply be woken afterward with the Rehydrate action — it is a
loose bundle, importable through the ordinary character import. Each bundle is
sealed under your passphrase rather than under anything kept in the databases
being replaced, so it opens perfectly well on the restored instance.

Untick the box to have the wipe take the archive shelf too.

## Understanding Backup Timing

**When to create backups:**

- **Before major changes:** System updates, configuration changes
- **Regularly:** Weekly or monthly for data protection
- **Before experiments:** Trying new features or settings
- **Before deletion:** Before deleting large amounts of data
- **Before migration:** Before moving to a different instance

**When NOT to restore with "Replace" mode:**

- Don't replace if you've made important changes since the backup was created
- Consider "Import" mode if you want to preserve current data

## Managing Your Backups

**Storing backups:**

- Save backups to your computer's documents folder
- Use cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud) for redundancy
- Consider external hard drives for large backups
- Name files clearly with dates (e.g., `quilltap-backup-2026-02-03.zip`)

**Backup organization tips:**

- Keep at least 2-3 recent backups
- Delete old backups when they're no longer needed
- Archive important milestone backups separately

## Troubleshooting

**Backup failed**

- Check that your system has enough disk space
- Try again after stopping any running tasks
- Check the browser console for error details

**Restore failed**

- Ensure the backup file is not corrupted
- Try a different backup file
- Check that the file is a valid Quilltap backup (.zip format)

**Backup is very large**

- Large file collections increase backup size
- Consider archiving old files you don't need
- Backups are compressed but can still be large with many images

**Files or document stores missing after restore**

- Three faults conspired here, and all three are now mended. Your archives are not at fault — the contents were always packed correctly; it was the unpacking that went astray, and an archive taken before the fix restores perfectly well on a current build.
  - Every document store and every link within it was refused on the way back in, on a technicality of bookkeeping, and the restore reported a cheerful success regardless. The result was a house full of furniture with every door bricked over: character vaults, project stores and group stores all present in the archive and none of them reachable.
  - The unpacker looked for your uploaded files under a filing scheme three revisions out of date, and so found none of them.
  - And it looked for them *before* it had rebuilt the stores those files must be placed into — which mattered enormously when restoring into a fresh or freshly-wiped instance, that being precisely the calamity a restore is kept for. Restoring over a populated instance had concealed the whole business, the stores happening to be there already.
- If you restored on an earlier build and found your vaults unreachable or your uploads absent, restore that same archive again on this one.

**API keys missing after restore**

- API keys are not backed up for security reasons
- Re-enter your API keys in connection profiles after restore
- The connection profile settings are preserved, just not the keys

## Best Practices

**Regular Backups:**

- Create a backup at least weekly
- Create before major system changes
- Keep at least 2-3 recent backups

**Backup Retention:**

- Don't keep backups forever - they take up space
- Delete backups older than 3 months unless you have a specific need
- Archive important backups to cloud storage

**Testing Restores:**

- Periodically test that you can restore successfully
- Verify your backup strategy works before you really need it
- Use "Import" mode to test without affecting current data

**Secure Storage:**

- Store backups in a secure location
- Don't share backup files - they contain all your data
- Consider encrypting sensitive backups
