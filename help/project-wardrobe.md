# Project Wardrobe

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/prospero)**

A garment, in the ordinary run of things, belongs to a single character — her own armoire, her own peculiar taste in hats. But some attire belongs not to any one player but to the *production* itself: the household livery worn by every footman, the regimental greatcoat issued to all who serve, the masquerade dominoes handed round at the door. **Project Wardrobe** is the shelf where such shared attire lives — garments stored in a project's own document store and offered to *every* character who takes the stage in that project's chats.

## Where Wardrobe Items Come From

Quilltap draws a character's wearable garments from four tiers, nearest to farthest:

1. **The character's own vault** — her personal armoire, hers alone.
2. **Her groups' wardrobes** — shared attire belonging to the [groups](groups.md) she is a member of, which she carries with her into any chat.
3. **The project's wardrobe** — shared attire belonging to the project, wearable by every character in its chats. *(This page.)*
4. **Quilltap General** — the household-wide collection of [Shared Items (archetypes)](wardrobe.md), available to every character in every chat regardless of project.

When the same item appears in more than one tier, the nearer tier prevails — a project may quietly shadow a household archetype with its own version, a group shadows the project, and a character's personal garment outranks the lot. A project garment becomes wearable the moment a chat belongs to that project; outside the project, it is simply not on offer.

## Garments Worn Without Being Asked

Mark a project garment as a **default** and it is put on at the opening of the curtain: every character joining a chat in that project arrives already wearing it, whether they were cast at the chat's creation, ushered in mid-scene by **Add Character**, or folded in when two conversations are merged. This is the proper way to dress a household — the livery goes on every footman without your having to dress each one by hand.

Defaults layer rather than compete. A character with a default coat of her own does not lose it to the project's waistcoat; she wears both, in the order the garments were made. And a character who would rather abstain need only keep a personal copy of the item with its default flag turned off — the personal copy shadows the project's, and she goes without.

A default **composite** ("House Livery" bundling coat, waistcoat, and boots) resolves to its component garments, so the character is dressed in the pieces, not in an abstraction.

## The Files Themselves

Each project wardrobe item lives as a Markdown file inside a folder called `Wardrobe/` within the project's official document store (the auto-created store named `Project Files: <your project name>`). The folder is conjured automatically the moment you visit the project page, so no incantation is required to bring it into being. The same `Wardrobe/` convention is used by character vaults and by Quilltap General, so an item may be moved between tiers simply by moving its file.

A wardrobe item carries a small block of **YAML frontmatter** declaring its metadata — title, the slots it covers (top, bottom, footwear, accessories, hair), an optional appropriateness note, and whether it is a default — with the descriptive prose below. Composite outfits (a "House Livery" bundling coat, waistcoat, and boots) are supported here exactly as in personal wardrobes; the system computes slot coverage automatically and refuses circular bundles.

## Tending the Collection

The **Wardrobe** card on each project's page is your atelier — and the [Wardrobe dialog](wardrobe.md) offers a second door to the same room: pick the project from its **Wardrobe** dropdown to edit, duplicate, star, move, copy, or delete the project's items in place. From the card itself you may:

- **Create** a new item via the **+ New wardrobe item** button — supply a title, an optional description, an optional **Portrait Cue**, the slots it covers, an optional appropriateness note, and (for composites) the existing project items it bundles. The Portrait Cue is a short, literal phrase whispered to the portraitist and the Lantern *in place of* the title when the bare name fails to conjure the right picture (the prose description, being for human eyes, never reaches the easel).
- **Edit** an existing item with its **Edit** button; the inline form returns pre-filled.
- **Archive** an item with the **Archive** button — a dust sheet rather than a bonfire. The garment withdraws from the project's wardrobe lists and from the outfit composer, and is withheld outright from any character choosing their own attire, while the file itself stays put. Tick **Show archived**, which keeps company with **+ New wardrobe item**, to see what you have stored away; each retired garment wears a small **Archived** badge and offers a **Restore** button. A character presently *wearing* an archived garment goes on wearing it — archiving tidies the drawer, it does not undress anybody.
- **Delete** an item with the **Delete** button, after a moment's confirmation. Equipped references across existing chats are cleaned up; composites that bundled the item tolerate its absence gracefully.

## Wearing Project Garments

Project wardrobe items behave exactly like any other once a chat belongs to the project. Characters may wear them through the Wardrobe dialog, dress themselves into them via the wardrobe tools, and have them appear in scene-state, avatar, and image-generation prompts — all without the item being duplicated into each character's personal armoire.

The project's `Wardrobe/` folder may also keep an optional page of **Dressing Instructions** (`instructions.md`) — a standing word, addressed to the character in the second person, consulted when a character in one of the project's chats dresses themselves and neither they nor their groups keep instructions of their own. Edit it from the collapsible **Dressing Instructions** panel in the [Wardrobe dialog](wardrobe.md#dressing-instructions-a-standing-word-with-the-valet) with the project selected.

## Keeping the Folder Healthy

Should you, in some moment of housekeeping zeal, delete the `Wardrobe/` folder or even the entire `Project Files:` document store, fear not — both are reconstructed at the next server start (and at the next visit to the project page, whichever comes first). The structure reappears empty, ready for fresh garments; previously-deleted files do not return.
