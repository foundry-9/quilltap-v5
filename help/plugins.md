> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/settings?tab=system&section=plugins)**

Plugins extend Quilltap's functionality by adding new features, themes, and capabilities. The Plugins tab is where you manage installed plugins, install new ones, and check for updates.

## Understanding Plugins

Plugins are packages of code that add functionality to Quilltap, such as:

- **Themes** — Customize the look and feel
- **Tools** — Add new capabilities to AI chats (search tools, calculations, etc.)
- **Providers** — Support for additional LLM services or storage backends
- **Storage backends** — Cloud storage support
- **Utilities** — Various utility features

Plugins can be:

- **Bundled** — Included with Quilltap by default
- **From NPM** — Installed from the Node Package Manager registry
- **From Git** — Installed from a Git repository
- **Manual** — Installed by manually copying files

## Accessing Plugins

1. Click **Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
2. Click the **Plugins** tab
3. You'll see three sub-tabs: **Installed**, **Upgrades**, **Browse**

## Viewing Plugin Status

At the top of the Plugins page, you see **Plugin Stats:**

- **Total** — Total number of plugins configured
- **Enabled** — Plugins currently active
- **Disabled** — Plugins installed but inactive
- **Errors** — Plugins with configuration problems

## The Installed Tab

View and manage all currently installed plugins.

### Understanding the Plugin List

For each installed plugin, you see:

- **Plugin Name & Title** — What the plugin does
- **Source Badge** — Where it came from (Bundled, NPM, Git, Manual, Installed)

## Understanding Plugin Capabilities

### Theme Plugins

**What they do:** Customize Quilltap's appearance

**Installation:** Install plugin → Go to Appearance tab → Select theme

**Examples:** Dark mode variants, custom color schemes, light themes

### Tool Plugins

**What they do:** Add new capabilities to AI chats

**Examples:**

- Web search tools
- Calculator tools
- Image analysis tools
- Custom integrations

**Usage:** Enable plugin → Use in chat (AI can use tools)

### Search Provider Plugins

**What they do:** Add web search backends for the Search Web tool

**Examples:**

- Serper (bundled) — Google search via serper.dev
- Custom web search integrations

**Installation:** Install → Add API key in Settings > API Keys → Enable web search in connection profile

### Provider Plugins

**What they do:** Add support for new LLM or service providers

**Examples:**

- Support for new LLM services
- Alternative embedding services
- Custom language model wrappers

**Installation:** Install → Create profile using new provider in relevant Settings tab

## Managing Multiple Plugins

### Best Practices

- **Keep updated** — Regularly check Upgrades tab
- **Disable if unused** — Reduce resource usage
- **Test before enabling** — Enable one at a time to isolate issues
- **Configure properly** — Some need setup before use
- **Review capabilities** — Know what each enabled plugin does

### Performance Considerations

- Each enabled plugin uses some resources
- Disable plugins you're not using
- Heavy plugins (like theme rendering) may impact performance
- Monitor system if many plugins are enabled

### Conflicts

Some plugins may conflict with each other:

- Two theme plugins won't conflict (only one active)
- Two tool plugins usually work together
- Provider conflicts rare (use whichever you prefer)
- Disable one if conflicts occur

## Advanced: Manual Plugin Installation

For local development or plugins not on NPM:

1. Have plugin files ready (usually downloaded from Git)
2. Place in Quilltap plugins directory
3. Go to Plugins tab
4. Might appear under "Manual" source
5. Enable and configure as normal

**Location varies by installation:**

- Self-hosted: Check documentation
- Managed instance: Usually not supported

## Related Settings

- [Appearance Settings](appearance-settings.md) — Theme plugins install here
- [API Keys](api-keys-settings.md) — Credentials for plugins that need them
- [Tools Usage](tools-usage.md) — Enable/disable tools per chat
- [Connection Profiles](connection-profiles.md) — If plugin adds new providers

## In-Chat Settings Access

Characters with help tools enabled can read your system-level settings during a conversation using the `help_settings` tool with `category: "system"`. This returns your LLM logging configuration and timezone settings. For a broader picture of what is configured across all categories, the `help_settings` tool with `category: "overview"` provides a high-level summary. Ask a help-tools-enabled character something like "What are my system settings?" and it will have a look.

## In-Chat Navigation

Characters with help tools enabled can navigate directly to this page:

`help_navigate(url: "/settings?tab=system&section=plugins")`
