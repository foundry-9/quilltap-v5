# Project Characters

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/prospero)**

Project characters are the cast of characters associated with a project. You can optionally control which characters can participate in project chats using the character roster feature.

## Character Access Modes

Projects have two modes for character access:

### Open Mode (Default)

**"Allow Any Character" = ON**

- Any character can start or join project chats
- No roster restrictions
- Most flexible option
- Characters are not tracked at the project level

**Best for:**
- General-purpose projects
- Exploratory worldbuilding
- Projects with many potential characters
- When you don't need access control

### Roster Mode

**"Allow Any Character" = OFF**

- Only characters in the roster can participate
- Provides controlled access
- Tracks which characters belong to the project
- Characters can be added/removed from roster

**Best for:**
- Focused roleplay campaigns
- Story projects with defined cast
- When character consistency matters
- Collaborative projects with specific participants

## The Character Roster

The roster is a list of characters approved for project participation.

### Viewing the Roster

1. Open the project
2. Go to the **Characters** section
3. See all characters in the roster

Each character card shows:
- Avatar or initials
- Character name
- Number of chats in this project
- Associated tags

### Auto-Adding to Roster

Characters are automatically added to the roster when:

1. You start a new chat with them in the project
2. You add them to an existing project chat
3. They're explicitly added via the roster interface

This means the roster grows organically as you use the project.

### Manually Adding Characters

1. Open the project
2. Go to Characters section
3. Click **Add Character** (if available)
4. Select character(s) from your library
5. Characters are added to roster

**Note:** If the interface doesn't have an explicit add button, simply start a chat with the character in the project.

### Removing Characters from Roster

1. Find the character in the roster
2. Click the **X** or **Remove** button on their card
3. Character is removed from the roster

**What happens:**
- Character can no longer join new project chats
- Existing chats with that character remain
- Past messages are preserved
- Character is not deleted from your library

## Enabling Roster Mode

### Turning On Roster Restrictions

1. Open the project
2. Go to **Settings** section
3. Find **Allow Any Character** toggle
4. Turn it **OFF**
5. Roster mode is now active

### Turning Off Roster Restrictions

1. Open the project
2. Go to **Settings** section
3. Find **Allow Any Character** toggle
4. Turn it **ON**
5. Any character can now participate

## Roster vs. Participation

Important distinction:

**Roster** = Characters approved to join
**Participation** = Characters who have actually chatted

A character can be:
- In roster but never participated (ready to join)
- In roster and actively participating (has chats)
- Removed from roster but has past chats (no new participation)

## Multi-Character Considerations

### Adding Characters to Group Chats

In roster mode:
- Only roster characters can be added to project chats
- Attempting to add non-roster character will fail
- Add them to roster first, then to chat

In open mode:
- Any character can be added
- No restrictions

### Character Selection

When starting a project chat or adding participants:
- Character picker may filter to roster-only
- Or show all characters with roster indicators
- Depends on mode and UI configuration

## Managing Your Cast

### Organizing by Project

Use projects to maintain character consistency:

1. Create project for a story/campaign
2. Enable roster mode
3. Add only relevant characters
4. All chats stay focused on your cast

### Tracking Character Usage

The roster shows:
- Which characters belong to the project
- How many chats each character has
- When they were last active (if shown)

### Evolving the Cast

As your project grows:
- Add new characters when introduced
- Remove characters who leave the story
- Roster reflects current cast

## Best Practices

### For Roleplay Campaigns

- Enable roster mode at start
- Add player characters and key NPCs
- Use roster to track cast
- Add new characters as they appear in story

### For Novel Projects

- Start with main characters in roster
- Add supporting characters as they're developed
- Keep roster focused on active cast
- Remove cut characters

### For Worldbuilding

- Consider open mode for exploration
- Or use roster for specific region/faction focus
- Characters represent different aspects of world

### For Collaboration

- Use roster to define who "lives" in this world
- Add collaborator's characters as needed
- Maintains shared understanding of cast

## Troubleshooting

### Can't add character to project chat

**Causes:**
- Roster mode enabled
- Character not in roster
- Character has configuration issues

**Solutions:**
- Add character to roster first
- Or enable "Allow Any Character"
- Check character has valid connection profile

### Character shows in roster but can't chat

**Causes:**
- Character missing connection profile
- Character is inactive/disabled
- API key issues

**Solutions:**
- Verify character has connection profile set
- Check character is active
- Confirm API key is valid

### Removed character still appearing in chats

**Expected behavior:**
- Past chats with removed characters remain
- Past messages are preserved
- Only future participation is blocked

**If appearing in new chats:**
- Refresh the page
- Check roster mode is active
- Verify character was actually removed

### Roster not updating

**Causes:**
- UI not refreshed
- Save failed
- Network issue

**Solutions:**
- Refresh the page
- Wait and check again
- Try removing/adding again
