# The Thinking, Shown — A Glimpse Behind the Curtain

Certain of the modern engines do not simply blurt their answer. They mutter to themselves first — a private rehearsal, a working-out, a few turns of the mental crank before the polished line is delivered. This back-of-house deliberation goes by the workshop name *reasoning*, or, less grandly, *thinking*. Quilltap can show it to you, should you wish to watch the gears turn.

## What you will see

When a thinking engine is at work, its reasoning arrives **live**, streamed into the bubble as the model mulls — set apart from the finished prose so there is never any confusion about which is which. The thinking is **dimmed**, **italicised**, nudged to the **right**, and tucked into a **collapsible** fold you may open or close at leisure. It marks itself plainly as what it is: a temporary working, not the final word. Once the engine settles on its answer, the prose proceeds beneath as usual.

The thinking is kept, too — so it survives a reload and may be re-read whenever the fold is opened, not merely glimpsed once as it streams past.

## A firm promise: thinking is for your eyes only

This is the load-bearing assurance, and it admits no exceptions worth mentioning: **a character's reasoning is shown to you and to no one else, and it is used for nothing but the showing.**

- It is **not** shared with other characters in the room.
- It is **not** folded into the history sent to the next engine on the following turn.
- It is **not** swept into conversation summaries, nor into the Commonplace Book, nor any other ledger.

It exists to be read, or to be left folded away — and that is the whole of its purpose. (The one strictly mechanical exception is invisible to you: when an engine pauses mid-turn to use a tool, a few of the engines demand their *own* current-turn reasoning handed straight back to themselves to finish that very turn. That is the engine talking to itself within a single breath; it is never another character's reasoning, and it is never the stored copy replayed as history.)

## Choosing what to show

Visibility is yours to set, at two levels.

- **Global default** — Settings → Chat → *Thinking / Reasoning*. Decide whether new chats reveal thinking at all, and whether the fold begins open or closed. Out of the box, thinking is **shown but collapsed**: present and one click away, without crowding the page.
- **Per-chat override** — inside any chat, the **Visibility** panel in the sidebar offers a *Thinking* control with three settings: **Inherit** (defer to the global default), **Show**, or **Hide**. Choose Hide and the reasoning is simply never rendered in that chat — though it is still quietly captured and stored, so a later change of heart costs you nothing.

Note well: these settings govern only the *showing*. The reasoning is captured all the same, whichever way the dial is turned.

## Which engines have thinking to show

It depends entirely on the engine and how it is configured. DeepSeek's thinking mode, Anthropic's extended thinking, Google's Gemini thinking models, the hybrid-reasoning GLM models from Z.AI, the reasoning summaries from OpenAI's and Grok's reasoning engines, and reasoning routed through OpenRouter can all surface their working. Some require a nudge in the connection profile — a thinking budget, say, or a request for a reasoning summary — before they will part with it. Z.AI's GLM models, by happy contrast, deliberate by default: their working streams in unbidden, and a fold appears with no coaxing at all. Should you prefer a GLM that holds its tongue, set **Thinking Mode** to *Disabled* in the connection profile. Engines that keep no separate counsel (or are not asked to share it) simply show nothing, and no fold appears.

A particular word on Google's latest: the **Gemini 3** family (including the rolling `gemini-pro-latest` alias) thinks diligently behind the curtain, but at present declines to pass its summarized musings down a *streaming* line — a quirk of Google's own making, not ours. And so, for the moment, a Gemini 3 model may reason at length yet show you nothing. Should you wish to actually *see* Gemini deliberate, point the connection profile at a **Gemini 2.5** model and pose it something worth chewing on. The day Google mends its streaming, the elder model's thoughts will appear here unbidden — no further fiddling required.
