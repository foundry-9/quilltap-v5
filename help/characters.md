# Characters Overview

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/aurora)**

Characters are the core of roleplaying in Quilltap. They represent personas that you can chat with, each with their own personality, background, and conversation style.

## What Are Characters?

Characters are AI-driven personalities you create and interact with. Each character has:

- **Identity** — A name, title, and unique personality
- **Background** — Detailed description, personality traits, and scenario
- **Configuration** — System prompts that guide how the character behaves
- **Profile** — Avatar image, tags, and organizational information
- **Relationships** — Connections to other characters and conversation partners
- **Chat History** — Record of all conversations with that character

Think of characters as personas you can have ongoing conversations with, where the AI maintains consistency with the character's defined personality and background.

## Character Types

Quilltap supports different character configurations:

### Control Mode

**LLM-Controlled (Chatbot)**

- The AI generates responses as the character
- You chat with the character like a conversation partner
- Best for: Interacting with characters, storytelling, roleplay
- Default mode for most characters

**User-Controlled (NPCs)**

- You decide what the character says and does
- Type responses as if you are the character
- Other characters respond to your character
- Best for: Direct character control, collaborative storytelling
- Labeled as "You Act As Character" in the UI

### Character Categories

**Regular Characters**

- Standard characters you create
- Can be LLM or user-controlled
- Organized on the main Characters page

**NPCs (Non-Player Characters)**

- Ad-hoc characters created on-the-fly in chats
- Often quick creations for single conversations
- Can be promoted to regular characters later
- Marked with "NPC" badge

## Understanding Character Attributes

- **Pronouns** — Optional pronouns for the character (e.g., he/him/his, she/her/her, they/them/their). Choose from presets or enter custom pronouns. When set, pronouns are included in system prompts so the LLM uses them correctly, and displayed on the character's view page.
- **Title** — Optional subtitle or role (e.g., "Bounty Hunter")
- **Description** — Long-form narrative about character

Structured metadata such as pronouns, aliases, and title is left untouched.
