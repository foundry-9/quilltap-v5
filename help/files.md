# Files Management

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/files)**

The Files page is where you upload, organize, and manage all your general files in Quilltap. General files are files not associated with any specific project, making them accessible to the AI in any chat.

## What Are General Files?

General files are:

- **Global** — Accessible to the AI in any chat (unlike project files which are project-specific)
- **Organized** — Can be stored in folders and organized by category
- **Accessible** — Can be read, previewed, edited, and managed from the Files page
- **Promotable** — Chat message attachments can be saved as permanent general files

Compare with:

- **Project Files** — Only accessible within a specific project's chats
- **Message Attachments** — Temporary files attached to individual messages
- **Character Images** — Specific to character profiles

## Accessing the Files Page

1. Click **Files** in the left sidebar (folder icon)
2. Or navigate to the Files section in the main menu
3. You'll see your general files organized in folders

## Understanding the Files Interface

### Main Elements

**Header Section:**

- Title: "Files"
- Description: "Browse and manage your general files (not in any project)"
- Quick action buttons

**File Browser:**

- Grid or list view toggle (top of browser)
- Breadcrumb navigation showing current folder path
- File/folder listing with actions

## File Organization

### Creating a Folder Structure

Plan your organization:

```
/
├── Documents/
│   ├── Research/
│   ├── Notes/
│   └── References/
├── Images/
│   ├── Characters/
│   ├── Locations/
│   └── Items/
├── Code/
│   └── Scripts/
└── Archives/
```

### Organization Tips

- **By Purpose** — Documents, Images, Code, etc.
- **By Project** — Folder for each project's files
- **By Date** — Year/Month subfolders for time-based organization
- **By Type** — Separate folders for images, documents, code

### Renaming Folders

To rename a directory:

1. Right-click the folder
2. Select **Rename**
3. Enter new folder name
4. Press Enter
5. Folder is renamed

**Note:** Renaming doesn't affect files inside the folder

### Deleting Folders

To remove an empty folder:

1. Right-click the folder
2. Select **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion
4. Folder is removed

**Note:** Can only delete empty folders. Move or delete files first.

## Using Files with AI

### AI Access to General Files

The AI in your chats can access files through the **Scriptorium document tools** (`doc_list_files`, `doc_read_file`, `doc_grep`, `doc_write_file`, and friends). See [Using Files with AI](files-with-ai.md) for the full workflow:

**What the AI can do:**

- **List Files** — See what files and folders exist
- **Read Files** — View content of text, code, markdown, or other files
- **Create Files** — Create new text/code files (with your permission)
- **Organize** — Create folders and manage file structure
- **Use Content** — Reference file content in conversations

### Requesting AI File Access

To ask the AI to work with files:

1. In a chat, mention: "Use my files to..." or "Check the files..."
2. The AI requests access to your files
3. You approve or deny the request
4. If approved, AI can read and work with files

**Examples:**

- "Can you review the code in my files?"
- "Summarize the documents in my Research folder"
- "Create a new file with the analysis results"

### File Permissions

When AI requests access:

- You approve or deny each request
- AI cannot access files without permission
- Some operations (like writing files) may require confirmation
- File scope determines what AI can see (general vs. project files)

## File Associations

Files can be associated with:

- **Characters** — Used as profile images, body descriptions, etc.
- **Chats** — Attached to messages within conversations
- **Projects** — Project-specific files only used in that project

### Viewing Associations

In list view, the "Associations" column shows:

- What characters use this file (profile pictures, descriptions)
- Which chats include this as an attachment
- How many times used across the system

Click on associations to see details or navigate to related content.

### Managing Associations

If you delete a file that's in use:

- Confirm dialog shows associations
- Choose to delete anyway (removes associations) or cancel
- Associations are cleared if file is deleted

If you move a file:

- Associations remain with the file
- Character profile images follow file to new location
- Chat attachments can reference file in new location

## Promoting Message Attachments

Files attached to chat messages can be saved as permanent general files:

1. In a chat, find a message with file attachment
2. Look for **Save as File** or **Make Persistent** option
3. Choose to save as:
   - **General File** — Accessible in any chat
   - **Project File** — Accessible in this project's chats
4. Choose folder location
5. File is saved and appears in Files page

**Benefits:**

- Keep important chat files organized
- Make temporary attachments permanent
- Organize files by purpose

## Filesystem Sync

Quilltap's file storage is backed by real directories on disk. You may add, remove, or rearrange files directly in the filesystem — much as one might reshuffle the card catalogue at a particularly well-appointed library — and Quilltap will detect the changes.

### How It Works

A vigilant filesystem watcher monitors your files directory at all times, rather like a tireless butler who notices when someone has rearranged the silverware. When files appear, vanish, or change on disk, the database is updated automatically:

- **New files** discovered on disk appear as "untracked" in the file browser
- **Removed files** are quietly de-catalogued from the database
- **Changed files** have their records updated to match

### Untracked Files

Files found on disk without a corresponding database record are marked as **untracked**. They appear with a subtle amber indicator in both grid and list views. These are perfectly usable files — they simply arrived by some means other than the usual upload button. The AI can access them, you can preview them, and they behave in every respect like proper files, save for a faint air of mystery about their origins.

Untracked files commonly appear when a chat or project is deleted but its generated images remain on disk, or after a database migration that could not match every file to its original record.

### Cleaning Up Untracked Files

When untracked files are present, a **cleanup button** (the broom icon with an amber count badge) appears in the file browser toolbar. Clicking it performs a quick analysis and presents a dialog with your options:

- **Relocate to /orphans/** — Moves unique untracked files into a dedicated `/orphans/` folder where you can review them at your leisure. Any untracked files that are mere duplicates of files already properly catalogued are quietly removed, since there is no sense in keeping two copies of the same photograph when one is merely skulking about without an invitation. The `/orphans/` folder appears as a regular folder in the file browser — you may browse its contents, preview files, and delete them individually as you see fit.

- **Delete All** — Permanently removes every untracked file from both disk and database. This is rather more decisive and cannot be undone, so do consider whether any of those uninvited guests might actually be someone you recognize before showing them all the door at once.

In both cases, de-duplication happens automatically: files whose content (identified by SHA-256 hash) already exists in a tracked file are always removed, since the tracked copy is the authoritative one.

### Manual Sync

Should you wish to trigger an immediate reconciliation — perhaps after copying a great many files into the directory at once — click the **Sync** button (the circular arrows icon) in the file browser header. This performs a thorough scan of the entire files directory and ensures the database reflects reality with the utmost fidelity.

### On-Disk Layout

Files are stored in a straightforward directory structure:

```
files/
├── _general/           # General files (not in any project)
│   ├── documents/
│   │   └── my-notes.txt
│   └── my-image.png
├── {project-id}/       # Project-specific files
│   └── research/
│       └── data.csv
└── _thumbnails/        # Auto-generated image thumbnails
```

You may browse this directory at your leisure. It lives at the configured data path under the `files/` subdirectory.

### Startup Reconciliation

Each time Quilltap starts, it performs a comprehensive reconciliation — a sort of morning inventory, if you will — comparing every file on disk against every record in the database. Files that have appeared are catalogued; records for vanished files are retired. This ensures that even if the watcher missed something (perhaps during a period of dormancy), the slate is wiped clean at each fresh beginning.
