/**
 * Transcript reconciliation — folding an authoritative read into what the tab
 * is already showing.
 *
 * Before the Salon's transcript became a subscribed read, the chat GET ran
 * twice in the life of a conversation turn and simply replaced the array:
 * whatever came back from the server *was* the display, swipe selection reset
 * to the newest variant, and any optimistic bubble vanished because the whole
 * array did. That is no longer safe. A realtime `{topic:'chats', id}` hint can
 * land at any moment — mid-stream, mid-swipe, while the operator is reading
 * history — so a read has to be merged rather than swapped in.
 *
 * Three properties this module exists to hold:
 *
 *   1. **The read is the authority.** Persisted rows win. A provisional bubble
 *      is dropped the instant the read carries a row for the same turn.
 *   2. **The operator's swipe selection survives.** Selection is remembered by
 *      the *id* of the chosen variant, not its index, so a regenerate that
 *      appends a variant (or a delete that removes one) doesn't yank the view
 *      onto a different reply.
 *   3. **Unchanged rows keep their object identity.** A refetch that changes
 *      nothing returns the very array it was given, so the signal graph bails
 *      out and the message list never remeasures — which is what keeps the
 *      scroll position still under a hint storm.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous: no fetching, no Angular. A character-faithful port of
 * v4 `app/salon/[id]/hooks/transcript-reconcile.ts` (`5029075bb`), pinned by
 * the recorded corpus in `transcript-reconcile.oracle.spec.ts`.
 *
 * This module supersedes `chat-view-model.ts::splitSwipeGroups`, which
 * collapsed groups to their newest variant with no selection carry, no
 * server-order tiebreak and no object identity.

 *      shows `[Attached: …]` and stores the bare prose, and a send that is
 *      nothing but attachments stores "Please look at the attached file(s)."

 * "Newly arrived" gates *both* passes — only a row the previous display did not
 * already hold may answer a bubble. Without it an older, identical line further
 * up the transcript could retire a bubble whose own row has not landed yet,
 * which is the flicker this whole overlay exists to avoid. Each authoritative
 * row absorbs at most one bubble, so sending the same line twice in a row
 * doesn't silently swallow the second one, and running the exact pass to
 * completion first keeps two tabs sending at once from stealing each other's
