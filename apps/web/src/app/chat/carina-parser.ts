/**
 * Carina Parser — inline LLM query detection (the CLIENT twin).
 *
 * Carina (the "reference desk") lets users and LLM characters pose a quick
 * question to a designated answerer character with a compact `@Name:` markup.
 * This module extracts that markup from raw message text.
 *
 * Forms (spec: `docs/v4/developer/features/carina.md`):
 *   `@CharName: question`          → public answer
 *   `@CharName? question`          → whispered answer (asker only)
 *   `@CharName: "quoted question"` → quoted (consumes up to the matching close)
 *   `@CharName? 'quoted question'` → straight or smart quotes both work
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Detection is per-line; the `@` must begin the line.
 *   - Only the FIRST line that yields a real (non-empty) question fires; any
 *     later `@Name` lines are ignored (one query per message).
 *   - Quoted questions never span multiple lines (we operate per-line).
 *
 * **Why a client twin at all.** The server owns the authoritative parser
 * (`quilltap-core::carina_parser`), and nothing in the SPA needed to know what a
 * Carina address looked like until In Their Own Words: its gate must NOT rehearse
 * a `@Name:` line, because the address is machinery that has to survive verbatim
 * (v4 `useImpersonationVoice.ts:66`). v4's client imports `lib/chat/carina-parser`
 * directly — one module serving both sides — which v5 cannot do across the
 * Rust/TypeScript boundary, so this is a character-for-character transcription of
 * v4's `lib/chat/carina-parser.ts` at `f4ad2c8d1`, pinned row-for-row by
 * `carina-parser.oracle.spec.ts` against a corpus recorded from v4's REAL module.
 *
 * Pure and import-free, exactly as v4's is.
 *
