/**
 * Shared math-rendering configuration for the markdown pipeline.
 *
 * A faithful port of v4's `lib/markdown/math.ts` (HEAD `b8b12695`). In v4 this
 * module exists so the two renderers — the client (`components/chat/
 * MessageContent.tsx`, via react-markdown) and the server
 * (`lib/services/markdown-renderer.service.ts`, via unified) — cannot drift.
 * v5 has a SINGLE renderer (`markdown-renderer.ts` renders every message
 * client-side through the unified pipeline), so there is nothing to keep in
 * sync here; the module is kept as its own file only to mirror v4's shape and
 * carry its why-comments.
 *
 * Supported delimiters:
 * - `$$...$$` inline and block math (remark-math native)
 * - `\(...\)` inline and `\[...\]` display math (normalized to `$$` form
 *   below, because CommonMark consumes `\(` as a character escape before any
 *   parse-time plugin could see it)
 *
 * Single-dollar inline math (`$x$`) is deliberately DISABLED: Quilltap chat is
 * full of ordinary prose where paired dollar amounts ("He slid $50 across the
 * table, then another $20") would otherwise be swallowed as garbled math.
 */

 * Options passed to `remark-math`. Kept in one place so the pipeline's math
 * config can't drift from the normalizer's assumptions.

 * parsing, so this rewrite must happen on the raw markdown string *before* the
 * parser runs — it is step 2.5 of the renderer's preprocessing chain, ahead of
