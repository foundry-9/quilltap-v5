/**
 * Shared math-rendering configuration for the markdown pipeline.
 *
 * A faithful port of v4's `lib/markdown/math.ts` (HEAD `7e6d13e5`). In v4 this
 * module exists so the two renderers — the client (`components/chat/
 * MessageContent.tsx`, via react-markdown) and the server
 * (`lib/services/markdown-renderer.service.ts`, via unified) — cannot drift.
 * v5 has a SINGLE renderer (`markdown-renderer.ts` renders every message
 * client-side through the unified pipeline), so there is nothing to keep in
 * sync here; the module is kept as its own file only to mirror v4's shape and
 * carry its why-comments.
 *
 * Supported delimiters:
 * - `$$...$$` inline and block math (remark-math native)
 * - `\(...\)` inline and `\[...\]` display math (normalized to `$$` form
 *   below, because CommonMark consumes `\(` as a character escape before any
 *   parse-time plugin could see it)
 * - single-`$...$` inline math *when the content is unmistakably LaTeX* —
 *   heuristically promoted to `$$...$$` below (see `promoteSingleDollarMath`)
 *
 * Single-dollar inline math is DISABLED at the parser level: Quilltap chat is
 * full of ordinary prose where paired dollar amounts ("He slid $50 across the
 * table, then another $20") would otherwise be swallowed as garbled math. But
 * models ignore the system-prompt steering toward `$$...$$` and emit standard
 * single-`$` math constantly, so we recover the clearly-mathematical spans in
 * preprocessing while leaving currency prose alone.
 */

/**
 * Options passed to `remark-math`. Kept in one place so the pipeline's math
 * config can't drift from the normalizer's assumptions. Single-dollar parsing
 * stays off — the clearly-LaTeX cases are promoted to `$$` in
 * `normalizeMathDelimiters` before the parser ever runs, so currency prose is
 * never at the parser's mercy.
