/**
 * Shared smart-typography configuration for the markdown pipeline — the v5 port
 * of v4 `lib/markdown/typography.ts` (`48396682`), Layer 1.6 Part A.
 *
 * v4 needs this file because it has **two** remark pipelines (the client's
 * react-markdown one for streaming messages, the server's unified one for
 * persisted ones) which are duplicated by convention: if they disagree, a
 * message visibly changes appearance the moment it stops streaming. v5 has ONE
 * renderer — {@link ./markdown-renderer} — because it dropped the server
 * `renderedHtml` fast path entirely, so there is nothing here to keep in step.
 * The file survives the port anyway, because everything in it except the plugin
 * wiring is a DECISION (which options, and when the typographer must stand
 * down), and those decisions are what the two apps must agree on.
 *
 * ## Why quotes render and dashes do not
 *
 * A `"` might be a quotation mark, an inch mark, a roleplay delimiter, or a
 * straight quote the writer wants left exactly as typed. Curling it is a
 * typesetting opinion, and opinions belong in the rendering layer: the stored
 * message keeps its straight quotes, so the model, the embeddings and every
 * export see precisely what was typed, and one toggle un-does the whole thing
 * across all of history. That also demotes smartypants' well-known apostrophe
 * failures (`'tis`, `'80s`) from data corruption to a cosmetic wrong guess.
 *
 * Dashes are the opposite case and are handled at the keystroke instead, by
 * `smart-typography/engine.ts`. See {@link SMARTYPANTS_OPTIONS} for why
 * `dashes` must stay off here permanently.
 *
 * ## Why a remark plugin, and not a string transform
 *
 * The raw-string pre-parse chain (`normalizeMathDelimiters` →
 * `escapeMarkdownInBrackets` → `linkifyBareQtapUris`) is the wrong place and
 * would mangle things: a typographer running there eats `\text{"x"}`, prime
 * marks, and hyphens inside TeX. As a remark plugin over the parsed mdast,
 * `code`, `inlineCode`, `math` and `inlineMath` are distinct node types and a
 * link target is a `url` property rather than a text node — so code, math and
 * URLs are excluded *structurally*, with no hand-written bail conditions to get
 * right forever.

/**
 * Options passed to `remark-smartypants`. Quotes only.
 *
 * Verified against `retext-smartypants` v6's own `Options` type, which is what
 * `remark-smartypants` v3 re-exports: the four keys below are the real names,
 * and an unrecognised key would be silently ignored — which is the one failure
 * mode this file most wants to avoid, because it would leave `dashes` on.
 *
 * - `quotes` — the entire point of Part A.
 * - `ellipses` — off. Part B owns `...`, at type time, where it becomes a real
 *   character in the writer's text.
 * - `dashes` — **off, permanently. This is not a tuning question.** Technical
 *   prose is full of long-option flags written without code formatting, and a
 *   render-time dash rule turns `run it with --verbose` into
 *   `run it with –verbose` invisibly: the source is right, the display is
 *   wrong, and the writer cannot tell why. Part B's type-time rule has no such
 *   problem, because a writer typing `--verbose` sees the dash appear at once
 *   and hits Backspace.
 * - `backticks` — off. It converts ``` `` ``` into a curly double quote, which
 *   is catastrophic in a markdown application.

/**
 * Whether the typographer must stand down for this render.
 *
 * The roleplay layer runs *after* parsing — on the HTML string — so a remark
 * plugin runs before it and the roleplay layer sees already-curled text. That
 * ordering is load-bearing, and it means anything downstream that matches on a
 * literal straight quote silently stops matching the moment Part A is switched
 * on. Bug 62 was exactly this failure in the shipped defaults; this guard is
 * what keeps a *user's* template from reproducing it.
 *
 * Two ways a template can be quote-sensitive, both checked:
 *
 * 1. **A declared wrap delimiter.** A user can name `"` or `'` as a delimiter in
 *    the roleplay-template editor, which compiles to an `rpBody` wrap pattern.
 *    Such a template also has `escapeMarkdownInBrackets` running over the *raw*
 *    string while `tokenizeInline` runs over curled text, so its escape pass and
 *    its match pass would disagree.
 * 2. **Straight-only dialogue detection.** A `openingChars`/`closingChars` set
 *    naming a straight quote without its curly counterpart stops matching the
 *    instant paragraphs start arriving curled — the bug-62 shape, arriving via a
 *    custom template instead of via the fallback.
 *
 * The shipped defaults trip neither: the built-in dialogue pattern carries no
 * `rpBody` group, and `DEFAULT_DIALOGUE_DETECTION` lists both the straight and
 * the curly double quote.
