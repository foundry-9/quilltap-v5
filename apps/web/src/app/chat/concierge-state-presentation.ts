/**
 * How the Concierge's four states are *shown* — the single source for every
 * word, icon and tone a UI puts on screen (v4
 * `lib/services/dangerous-content/concierge-state-presentation.ts`, new at
 * `c43d3b1b4`).
 *
 * Its sibling, `concierge-state.ts`, is the single source for *deriving* a
 * state from a chat's two stored fields. This module never derives anything;
 * hand it a {@link ConciergeState} and it hands back the presentation.
 *
 * It exists because the same four states were being described in three places
 * with three different sets of words — the Salon header pill's `title`
 * strings, the sidebar's helper sentences, and the list asterisk's terse
 * "Flagged as dangerous" — and a fourth consumer by copy-paste is how the copy
 * drifts. The `detail` sentences below are the sidebar's, moved verbatim: they
 * are the fullest statement of each state and already in voice.
 *
 * Shared contract §B: the table lives ONCE, here. v4's module has no server
 * consumer (its readers are the sidebar, the Salon header and the mark), so
 * the Rust core builds no twin and emits no presentation string. What the two
 * sides DO share is the predicate name — `conciergeStateUsesUncensoredRoute`
 * in `concierge-state.ts`, `concierge_state_uses_uncensored_route` in the
 * core's `chat_override`.
 *
 * Every string here is pinned against v4's REAL module, executed and emitted
 * to `concierge-state-presentation.v4.json` by
 * `harness/oracle/cases/concierge-presentation.mjs` — see the spec.
