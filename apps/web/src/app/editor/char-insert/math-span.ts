/**
 * "Is the cursor inside a math span?" — Tier B (pure string work).
 *
 * ### Why this exists
 *
 * Quilltap ships KaTeX. `$$\phi$$` is LaTeX that KaTeX renders; substituting φ
 * into the source would BREAK the math. A `\` typeahead firing inside math is
 * the single most likely way the Unicode feature annoys the person who most
 * wants it, so the Unicode trigger bails whenever this returns true.
 *
 * ### What counts as math
 *
 * Mirrors v4's `lib/markdown/math.ts`, which is the authority on what Quilltap
 * actually renders — read it before touching this file. In particular
 * `REMARK_MATH_OPTIONS` sets `singleDollarTextMath: false`, but
 * `normalizeMathDelimiters` PROMOTES single-`$` spans and rewrites `\(…\)` /
 * `\[…\]` into `$$` form before the parser ever sees them. So all four
 * delimiter styles are math by the time it matters here.
 *
 * ### Where it deliberately differs
 *
 * `math.ts` decides whether a CLOSED span should be promoted. This decides
 * whether an UNCLOSED one is being typed, which is a weaker question, so the
 * single-`$` rule is coarser: a `$` opens math unless the next character is
 * whitespace or an ASCII digit — the currency shape (`$5`, `$1,000`) that
 * single-dollar parsing was disabled to protect. `costs $5 and \ph` therefore
 * still opens a menu, which is the case the corpus pins.
 *
 * The bias is deliberate: a false positive costs a writer one menu that did not
 * open, and a false negative costs them a formula that silently stopped
 * rendering. Prefer the former.
 *
 * No imports. Pinned by `__fixtures__/unicode-trigger-vectors.json`.
