/**
 * Trigger detection — Tier B (pure logic).
 *
 * Decides where an `<opener>query` trigger starts and ends. This is the whole
 * reason the emoji typeahead does not fire on `http://`, `10:30`, `a:b`,
 * `C:\Users` or `:)`, and the reason the Unicode typeahead does not fire on a
 * markdown escape.
 *
 * ### Why `\` does not collide with markdown escapes
 *
 * A markdown escape is a backslash followed by ASCII **punctuation** — `\*`,
 * `\_`, `\[`, `\\`. A backslash followed by a **letter** is never an escape; it
 * is literal text. The Unicode profile's query alphabet excludes punctuation
 * entirely, so the two syntaxes occupy disjoint space and `\*` can never open a
 * menu. This is not obvious and someone will worry about it; that is what this
 * paragraph is for.
 *
 * Pinned by `__fixtures__/{emoji,unicode}-trigger-vectors.json`, copied verbatim
 * from v4. No imports.
