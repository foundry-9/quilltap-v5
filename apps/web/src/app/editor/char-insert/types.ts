/**
 * Character-insertion engine types — Tier B (pure logic).
 *
 * ⚠ PORTABILITY: this file, and every other file in `char-insert/`, imports
 * NOTHING — no Angular, no ProseMirror, no TanStack, not even a repo helper.
 * It is v4's `lib/char-insert/` copied near-verbatim (v4 enforces the rule with
 * an ESLint `no-restricted-imports` override on `lib/char-insert/**`; the same
 * discipline holds here by hand). The four corpora under `__fixtures__/` are
 * byte-copies of v4's, replayed by the specs beside them — **if a port
 * disagrees with a corpus, fix the port, not the vectors.**
 *
 * ONE engine, TWO dataset profiles: emoji (`:` trigger) and Unicode (`\`
 * trigger). Nothing here knows which one it is serving — the differences live
 * entirely in `profiles/`.
