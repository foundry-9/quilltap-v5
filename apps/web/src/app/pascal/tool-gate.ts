/**
 * The availability gate — whether a tool is dealt to this invoker at all (v4
 * `lib/pascal/tool-gate.ts`).
 *
 * An outcome table decides what happens once a tool is run. A gate decides
 * something earlier and coarser: whether the tool appears on the roster in the
 * first place. A definition that declares `availableWhen` is offered only to an
 * invoker whose fact sheet satisfies it; one that declares `withheldWhen` is
 * kept from an invoker whose sheet satisfies THAT. A definition declaring
 * neither is offered to everyone, which is every file written before this key
 * existed.
 *
 * ## Why metadata alone
 *
 * The gate is answered before the deal. There is no roll to test, no resolved
 * parameters (nobody has called anything yet), and no consult. What a character
 * carries into the room is their `metadata.json`, so that is the only subject a
 * pre-roll test can honestly have — and the reason a gate's operands are
 * literals rather than `$param`/`$state` references.
 *
 * ## Fail-soft, and therefore fail-CLOSED for `availableWhen`
 *
 * Metadata tests never throw: an absent key, a list, a value of the wrong type
 * all simply fail to match (see {@link metadataComparatorHolds}). Read through
 * the gate, that means a character with no sheet at all fails every
 * `availableWhen` — the tool is withheld — and satisfies no `withheldWhen` — the
 * tool is offered. Both are the safe reading of "we could not establish that
 * this character qualifies".
 *
 * CLIENT-SAFE: pure, and imports only client-safe modules, so the Workbench can
 * tell an author whether a fact sheet would be dealt to without a round trip.
