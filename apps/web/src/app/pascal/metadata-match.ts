/**
 * Fail-soft metadata comparison — one semantics table, two callers (v4
 * `lib/pascal/metadata-match.ts`).
 *
 * A `metadata` comparator names a key on a character the definition has never
 * met, so nothing about the subject is knowable at load time: the key may be
 * absent, may hold a list, may hold a string where the table wanted a number.
 * Each of those simply fails to match. That rule is load-bearing in two places —
 * the outcome table (`matchesWhen`, at roll time) and the availability gate
 * (`evaluateToolGate`, before a tool is ever offered) — and a second
 * implementation of it would drift the moment one side gained a comparator.
 *
 * CLIENT-SAFE: no logger, no repositories, no node built-ins. The Workbench runs
 * this in the browser to tell an author whether a fact sheet would be dealt to,
 * against the same rules the roster loader runs on the server.
 *
 * v5 note: the SERVER's copy of this table is the Rust port; this is v4's
 * client-safe module rendered where v4 itself uses it — in the browser. The
 * decline strings are carried verbatim because a caller may log them.
