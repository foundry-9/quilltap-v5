/**
 * Smart typography — Tier A: the rule engine.
 *
 * The near-verbatim v5 copy of v4 `lib/smart-typography/engine.ts` (`48396682`),
 * which was written to be copied: Layer 1.6, Part B decides what happens when a
 * writer types `-` or `.` — `--` becomes an en dash, `---` an em dash, `...` an
 * ellipsis. Unlike the render-time quote curling of Part A, these substitutions
 * write real characters into the text, because a writer typing `--`
 * unambiguously means a dash — the hyphen is a keyboard workaround for a
 * character with no key, and the dash is genuinely part of what was written.
 *
 * **This file imports nothing.** Not Angular, not ProseMirror, not a repo path
 * — nothing outside the standard library, which an ESLint
 * `no-restricted-imports` override on v4's `lib/smart-typography/**` enforces on
 * that side. Keep it that way here: the surrounding editor is ProseMirror rather
 * than Lexical and nothing else transfers, so this file is the ONLY thing the
 * two apps share. Every decision the feature makes lives here; if the
 * ProseMirror adapter grows an `if` about dashes, that `if` is in the wrong
 * file.
 *
 * The companion fixture corpus (`fixtures/typography-vectors.json`) is the
 * contract between the two apps: it is copied byte-for-byte from v4 and
 * `engine.spec.ts` asserts identical outputs. If the port disagrees with the
 * corpus, fix the port.
 *

 * Returns `null` when nothing applies, which is the overwhelmingly common case
 * and must stay cheap: this runs on every keystroke.
 *
 * ### The dash ladder
 *
 * Three hyphens produce, in sequence: `-`, then {@link EN_DASH} (the second
 * consumes the first), then {@link EM_DASH} (the third consumes the en dash).
 * A fourth yields `—-`, which is harmless and doubles as an escape hatch for a
 * writer who wants literal hyphens. This is strictly better than matching `--`
 * or `---` by lookahead, which cannot be evaluated at a keystroke without
 * buffering the writer's input and guessing when they have stopped.
 *
 * First match wins; the table is small enough that the order is the whole
 * specification.
