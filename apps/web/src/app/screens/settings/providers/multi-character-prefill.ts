/**
 * Multi-character turn anchoring — the `[Name]` assistant prefill switch
 * (v4 `lib/llm/multi-character-prefill.ts`, `23af7146`; thinking-aware since
 * `97d2fcb5`, bug 85).
 *
 * In a multi-character chat every reply is anchored to the character whose turn
 * it is, by one of two routes:
 *
 *  - **prefill** — the request ends with an assistant message containing
 *    `[Character Name]`, so the model structurally continues only that
 *    character's line;
 *  - **prose** — an instruction is appended to the system message instead,
 *    leaving the conversation ending on a user message.
 *
 * Which route suits a profile is a property of the model on the other end, not
 * of the provider, so it lives on the connection profile as
 * `multiCharacterPrefill`. Reasons to turn it off:
 *
 *  - Anthropic 4.6+ **rejects** a request that ends with an assistant message
 *    ("This model does not support assistant message prefill"), which is why
 *    Anthropic profiles default to off. This one really is a property of the
 *    provider: it holds whether or not thinking is on.
 *  - A model that will run a **thinking** turn. Two providers are on record
 *    breaking on a prefill only while thinking — Ollama never opens the
 *    reasoning block behind a prefilled turn, so `message.thinking` comes back
 *    empty (v4 bug 68), and DeepSeek 400s demanding the `reasoning_content`
 *    that produced an assistant turn a synthetic prefill never had (v4 bug
 *    85). They are also the population that needs the anchor least: a model
 *    spending tokens working out whose turn it is does not need `[Name]` put
 *    in its mouth. The question is asked per profile through `thinking-turn`,
 *    not per provider, so a thinking-off Ollama or DeepSeek profile keeps the
 *    stronger anchor.
 *  - Some models visibly spend their reply working out whether `[Name]` was an
 *    instruction to them or a previous speaker's slip.
 *
 * **This is the CLIENT half only** (v4 `defaultMultiCharacterPrefill`): the
 * seed the profile editor shows and re-seeds on a provider or model switch.
 * The resolution v4 calls `profileUsesNamePrefill` is the server's business —
 * v5 keeps it in the core (P4.D79's `services/multi_character_prefill.rs`),
 * and nothing in the SPA resolves a stored value on its own: the tri-state
 * `null` reaches the form and is replaced by this default so the box reflects
 * the behaviour the server would actually pick.
