/**
 * "Will this profile run a thinking turn?" — the one question, one answer
 * (v4 `lib/llm/thinking-turn.ts`, `97d2fcb5`).
 *
 * Thinking is not just a display feature. It changes what a request may look
 * like, and two providers are on record refusing an assistant `[Name]` prefill
 * *only* while thinking:
 *
 *  - **Ollama** opens a thinking model's reasoning block from the chat
 *    template at the start of the assistant turn, so a prefill means the block
 *    is never opened and `message.thinking` comes back empty (v4 bug 68);
 *  - **DeepSeek** 400s with *"The `reasoning_content` in the thinking mode
 *    must be passed back to the API"* on a request that ends with an assistant
 *    turn it never produced the reasoning for (v4 bug 85).
 *
 * Both were discovered the hard way because the multi-character prefill
 * default was provider-shaped when the property it was trying to capture is
 * *model*-shaped. This module supplies the model-shaped answer that
 * `multi-character-prefill` now asks for.
 *
 * Two facts make it up, because providers differ on where the truth lives:
 *
 *  1. **The profile's explicit choice** — a `thinkingTurnRule` declared by the
 *     provider plugin names the `parameters` key that switches thinking on or
 *     off, and which values mean which. Only the plugin knows its own option
 *     keys; the host reading them by hand is exactly what bug 68 refused.
 *  2. **The model's own habit** — `ModelInfo.thinksByDefault`, consulted when
 *     the profile says nothing. `deepseek-v4-flash` reasons with
 *     `parameters: '{}'`; Anthropic and Ollama thinking are opt-in.
 *
 * The rule is declarative rather than a predicate function on purpose: the
 * connection-profile editor needs the same answer in the browser, where a
 * server-side plugin closure cannot be called. A rule serialises out through
 * the providers listing; a closure does not.
 *
 * **This is the browser twin** of the shared evaluator (v4 runs the one file
 * on both sides; v5's server half lives in `quilltap-core` — P4.D97) — never
 * re-derive the answer, on either side.
