/**
 * Two questions about a provider and an API key (v4 `lib/llm/api-key-support.ts`,
 * bug 81).
 *
 * `configRequirements.requiresApiKey` used to answer both of them, and they are
 * genuinely the same question for a provider that is wholly hosted (Anthropic,
 * OpenAI, Google — must have a key, may have a key) or wholly local (Ollama —
 * must not, may not). OpenAI-Compatible is the one that splits them: the same
 * provider points at an unauthenticated llama.cpp on localhost *and* at a hosted
 * endpoint behind a bearer token. With a single flag, `false` was the only
 * workable value, and `false` then removed the provider from the Add-New-API-Key
 * list and from the profile form's key field alike — so a hosted
 * OpenAI-compatible endpoint could not be configured at all.
 *
 * The plugin capability `acceptsApiKey` answers question 2 and is optional:
 * omitted, it means "same answer as `requiresApiKey`", so every provider that
 * predates it keeps exactly its present behaviour.
 *
 * Deliberately free of every other import, as v4's module is: the settings UI
 * asks the same question of a `providerList` payload that the server asks of the
 * manifest registry (`ConfigRequirements::accepts_api_key`).
