 * Reading a HuggingFace repository id out of a LoRA source (v4

 * whether a source is even askable-about before it offers a Query button, and
 * that decision runs in the browser. This module is therefore **pure and
 * dependency-free** — no logger, no fetch, nothing that would drag the
 * server's world into the client bundle. P4.D138 carries the Rust twin of the
 * same rules for the host-side lookup; this is the client half.
