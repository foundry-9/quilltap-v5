/**
 * Prompt-field hint strings — the single source for the label, helper, and
 * worked-example copy shown above every prompt-bearing field in the UI.
 *
 * v4 `components/prompt-fields/field-hints.ts` (commit `a6870c5a`), transcribed
 * byte-for-byte: this is v4's CLIENT mirror of
 * `lib/services/character-field-semantics.ts` (the server-side single source for
 * AI generation systems), so in v5 it mirrors `quilltap-core`'s port of that
 * same chokepoint. Keep the two aligned: when a field's vantage point or voice
 * guidance changes there, change it here in the same pass, and vice versa.
 *
 * The `example` lines model the correct form of address for each field
 * without ever naming grammatical person — models and people alike copy the
 * shape of an example more reliably than they follow terminology. Fields
 * whose referent is the speaking character are exampled in second person
 * ("You keep your worry behind your teeth"); fields read only by others are
 * exampled from outside ("Ariadne is a research librarian…"); physical
 * descriptions stay noun phrases because they also feed the image pipelines.
 * See v4 docs/developer/features/complete/prompt-person-consistency.md §5.
 *
 * Voice: labels and helpers stay in the house register; examples stay plain —
 * their job is to model a sentence shape, and ornament would defeat that.
 *
 * ⚠ The helper strings carry TYPOGRAPHIC apostrophes (’), not ASCII ones. The
 * parity spec compares every string against a second transcription, so a
 * silent character swap on either side goes red.
