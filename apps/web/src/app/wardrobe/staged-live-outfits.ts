/**
 * Staged Live-tab outfit edits — a port of v4 `lib/wardrobe/staged-live-outfits.ts`
 * (new at 4.8.2, commit `07d4ccce`, "bug 61").
 *
 * The Wardrobe dialog's "Wearing now" tab stages every gesture locally and
 * commits once, on Done. Two moments in that lifecycle have to reckon with a
 * worn snapshot that has not arrived yet, and both live here so they can be
 * reasoned about — and tested — away from the dialog's render logic.
 *
 *  - `rebaseStagedSlots` replays the gestures made during the window before the
 *    snapshot landed onto the true worn slots, so a fast click is neither
 *    overwritten by the first seed nor committed against an empty base.
 *  - `classifyStagedOutfits` separates "nothing changed" from "we never learned
 *    what clean was", which the flush used to treat identically — reporting
 *    success for an outfit it never sent (Bug 61).
 *
 * `equippedSlotsEqual` moved here with them (v4 lifted it out of the dialog in
 * the same commit); it lived in `equipped-slots.ts` before.
 *
 * This is the race v5 measured first (a 3 ms margin — dogfood finding #78,
 * filed upstream as v4 Bug 61 and deflaked gesture-level in
 * `e2e/wardrobe-flow.spec.ts`); v4 has now fixed it, so v5 ports the fix.
