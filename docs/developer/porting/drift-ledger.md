# The v4 drift ledger

**The single standard record of where v4 stands relative to the oracle
baseline, what each drift commit touches, where it intersects work this port
has already landed, and what has been done about it.** Written by
`/driftcheck` (and by `/unify` when a round moves the baseline); read by
`/setupphase`, `/carryout`, `/unify`, and `/dogfood`. Those commands do NOT
re-derive drift — they run the §2 freshness probe and then trust this file.

Ownership: this file is written only from a main-checkout session
(`/driftcheck`, `/setupphase` marking rows ORDERED, `/unify` marking rows
ABSORBED, `/dogfood` when a walk changes a row's facts). **Lane agents never
write it** — a lane that finds the probe failing STOPs and reports instead.

---

## §1 Current state

_Updated only by `/driftcheck` and `/unify`. Every field here is what the §2
probe verifies against._

- **Oracle baseline:** `0b0617fee` — "fix(images): verify a describer saw the
  image; hash the bytes we store (bugs 116-118)" (v4 main, 2026-09-02
  21:04 -0500, v4 `4.9.0-dev.120`), adopted at the `0b0617fee` drift catch-up
  round unification (P4.D148 ∥ P4.D149 ∥ P4.D150 ∥ P4.D151 ∥ P4.D152,
  2026-09-03).
- **Probed at the follow-ups round 2 unification (2026-09-04): PASS** — v4 `main`
  still `15573c3a1`, tree clean, both logs empty; the baseline did NOT move
  (the round absorbed no drift row) and every regen ran from a pinned worktree
  at `0b0617fee`. The §1 fields below stand as checked on 2026-09-03.
- **Checked:** 2026-09-03 (a full `/driftcheck` run AFTER the unification — the
  third probe of the day; the two earlier ones were the unification's own, run
  before the cherry-picks and before the gate). **Nothing has moved on either
  branch since the baseline was adopted:** every §1 field below re-measured
  identical, so this check adds no §3 row and changes no disposition.
- **v4 `main` HEAD at check:** `15573c3a1` — "fix(optimizer): a non-array
  sub-step answer no longer kills the run (bug 119)" (2026-09-02 21:59 -0500,
  v4 `4.9.0-dev.121`) — **ONE commit past the baseline.** `origin/main` is
  level with `main`. Unmoved since the 2026-09-03 `/driftcheck`
  (`15573c3a1..main` is empty).
- **v4 `bugfix` tip at check:** `3a76b17df` — **unmoved** (the bare 4.8.4 fork
  marker). Re-measured by CONTENT again at this check per §4 step 2: the
  `main..bugfix` diff over `lib/ app/ packages/ plugins/` is 568 files /
  +6,869 / **−43,355** — net-negative because bugfix is *behind* main, which is
  exactly the squash-topology signature; its long `main..bugfix --oneline`
  commit list is the historical lineage, not unabsorbed work. Nothing genuinely
  unabsorbed.
- **v4 `release` tip at check:** `8736d7042` ("release: 4.8.4") — unchanged.
- **Checkout at check:** branch `main`, **tree CLEAN** (`git status --short`
  empty). `git worktree list` shows the checkout alone — the unify's own pinned
  worktree (`/tmp/qt-v4-pin-unify-0b0617fee`) was removed at cleanup and no
  `/tmp/qt-v4-pin-*` path survives, so the next lane builds its pin fresh.
- **Verdict: DRIFT PENDING — 1 commit past the baseline.** §3 holds ONE
  UNPROCESSED row, `15573c3a1` (bug 119, the character optimizer — **unported
  v5 surface**, `p4.9k`; the row's obligation is to carry the post-fix shape
  into that round, not a catch-up lane now). It stayed in §3 across this
  baseline move BY THE PREVIOUS §1's OWN INSTRUCTION — not swept along.
  **Not a convergence** (v4's own filing).
- **Regen rule in force: PIN REQUIRED** at **`0b0617fee`** (§5.1 — a
  lane-unique detached worktree, the sweep driver's `--v4 "$PIN"`) — because
  HEAD is past the baseline. The one drift commit touches
  `lib/services/character-optimizer.service.ts` only, which no oracle imports,
  so a pin-free regen would NOT poison any existing family today; the rule
  stays PIN REQUIRED anyway because that is the rule, and because the next v4
  commit may not be so polite.
- **Release shape:** still no `release: 4.9.0` squash and no 4.9 bugfix fork;
  v4 develops on `main` alone. Keep probing BOTH branches.
- _Superseded (the EARLIER 2026-09-03 `/driftcheck` verdict, the one that ran
  before the round unified — not the post-unification check recorded above):
  DRIFT PENDING — 6
  commits past `6d2a50382`, five ORDERED to the in-flight `0b0617fee` round
  + `15573c3a1` new and UNPROCESSED, PIN REQUIRED at `6d2a50382`. The round
  unified 2026-09-03 and moved the baseline to `0b0617fee`; the five rows are
  in §6._
- _Superseded (the 2026-09-02 verdicts): recorded in §6's round entry and in
  `status-log.md`'s round record._

## §2 The freshness probe

What every consuming command runs before trusting §1 — four read-only
commands, no classification, no judgment:

```bash
git -C ~/source/quilltap-server branch --show-current
git -C ~/source/quilltap-server status --short
git -C ~/source/quilltap-server log --oneline <§1 main HEAD>..main
git -C ~/source/quilltap-server log --oneline <§1 bugfix tip>..bugfix
```

Pass = the branch and tree state match §1 and both logs are **empty**. Then
§1's verdict and regen rule stand; proceed on them. Any mismatch = the ledger
is stale: `/setupphase`, `/unify`, and `/dogfood` run `/driftcheck` (or its
§4 procedure) before continuing; a `/carryout` lane **STOPs and reports**.

A dirty tree matters even when HEAD hasn't moved: uncommitted `lib/`, `app/`,
`packages/`, or `plugins/` edits poison any regen run from the checkout
(§5.1's mid-lane note). Infra-only dirt (CI files, docs) still gets recorded
here so the next probe doesn't re-alarm on it.

## §3 The drift table

Classes: **PORT** (behavior change on a ported surface), **PORT-NEW** (new v4
feature to port), **CONVERGENCE** (v4 adopting a fix this port made first —
both-directions pins will trip at the baseline move *by design*; retire them
by measurement, §5.4), **NO-PORT?** (docs/infra/tests-only candidate —
needs ratification with evidence, never by subject line alone).

Dispositions: **UNPROCESSED** → **ORDERED(order-id)** (set by `/setupphase`)
→ **ABSORBED(round)** or **NO-PORT-RATIFIED(round)** (set by `/unify` when
the baseline moves past the commit). A row leaves this table for §6 only
when absorbed/ratified.

| sha | date | subject | class | intersects (already-ported work) | disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| `15573c3a1` | 2026-09-02 | fix(optimizer): a non-array sub-step answer no longer kills the run (bug 119) | **PORT (deferred surface — no v5 counterpart today)** | **NOT a convergence** — v4's own filing, from a screenshot of the Refine-from-Memories confirmation screen showing the minified `q.filter is not a function`. **Hunks: ONE lib file, `lib/services/character-optimizer.service.ts` (+60/-4), three changes.** (a) NEW exported `coerceSuggestionArray(value: unknown): OptimizerSuggestion[]` placed after `coerceSuggestionText` — array passes through; non-object/nullish → `[]`; else the FIRST array-valued property among the ordered key list `['suggestions','items','results','data','amendments']`; else a lone object whose `field` is a `string` becomes a one-element array (`field` is called "the shape's fingerprint"); else `[]`. (b) inside the sub-step body, `parseLLMJson<OptimizerSuggestion[]>(raw)` becomes `parseLLMJson<unknown>(raw)` + `coerceSuggestionArray(...)`, and a non-array answer logs `logger.warn('[CharacterOptimizer] Sub-step answered with a non-array; coerced', {characterId, subStep: label, parsedType, recovered})` — note `parsedType` is computed as `Array.isArray(rawParsed) ? 'array' : typeof rawParsed` **inside a branch already known to be non-array**, so it can only ever emit `typeof`; the pre-existing unparseable-JSON `catch` is untouched. (c) the closure `runSubStep` is renamed `runSubStepCore` and a NEW `runSubStep` wraps it in try/catch, logging `logger.error('[CharacterOptimizer] Sub-step failed unexpectedly; continuing', {characterId, subStep: label}, err)` and emitting `onProgress({type:'substep_complete', step:'generating', partialSuggestions: []})` — so one bad pass no longer aborts the fan-out (general fields / each scenario / each system prompt / physical description / wardrobe / aliases / proposed prompts). Explicitly **NOT done** (v4 says so): Zod validation at the sub-step boundary, and moving `logLLMCall` ahead of the filter chain. → **v5 intersection: NONE.** The character optimizer has **never been ported** — `m6-screen-parity.md:546` lists `CharacterOptimizerModal` (`components/characters/optimizer/CharacterOptimizerModal.tsx`, `CharacterDetailView.tsx:373`) as **absent → MISSING → `p4.9k`**, and `phase-4.md:779` / `:5099` carry it among the tier-3 LLM-service deferrals (ai-wizard / optimizer / rename / ai-import); grep confirms no `character_optimizer` / `OptimizerSuggestion` / `runSubStep` anywhere in `crates/` or `apps/`. So there is **nothing to port now and no family to regenerate** — the obligation is that **`p4.9k` ports the POST-FIX shape**, and its work order must cite this sha so the pre-fix inline `.filter` is never transcribed. Also note the class does not transfer mechanically: v4's bug is a TypeScript *cast* (`return JSON.parse(cleaned) as T`) that JS never checks, whereas v5 has no `parseLLMJson` twin at all (`services/answer_confirmation.rs:464 extract_json` returns a `Value` and every reader is explicit) — a Rust `serde_json` deserialize into `Vec<T>` would return `Err`, landing in the equivalent of the parse `catch` rather than throwing at `.filter`. The port's live obligation is therefore the *design* lesson v4's `bugs.md` states — normalise before treating a model answer as an array, and contain a fan-out failure to the pass that caused it — carried into `p4.9k`'s order, plus the coercion table byte-for-byte (the key list is ordered and load-bearing). **NO-PORT within the commit:** `README.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/developer/bugs.md` (+ the new `bugs/fixed/bug-119-optimizer-substep-non-array.md`, 186 lines — read it when `p4.9k` runs), the 47 new lines in `__tests__/unit/lib/services/character-optimizer-helpers.test.ts`, and the version bumps (`4.9.0-dev.120` → `.121` across `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `packages/quilltap/package.json`). | UNPROCESSED |

## §4 How a full drift check runs (the `/driftcheck` procedure)

1. **Read §1** for the baseline and the previously recorded state. Never
   take the baseline from memory — CLAUDE.md's Status and this file must
   agree; if they don't, that disagreement is itself a finding to report.
2. **Both branches, always.** Since v4's 4.8.0/4.8.1 releases (2026-08-12)
   v4 develops on TWO branches: `main` (next-dev) and `bugfix` (patch
   maintenance). Release flow: a `bugfix: started X.Y bug branch` commit
   forks the branch; fixes land there; `release: X.Y` squashes back onto
   main. The topology is squash-like — bugfix commits are NOT ancestors of
   main — so `git log <baseline>..main` misses nothing but shows the release
   squash, while `git log <baseline>..bugfix` shows the whole historical
   lineage and looks alarmingly long. **Measure bugfix by CONTENT, never the
   commit list:** `git log main..bugfix --oneline -- lib/ app/ packages/`
   for candidates, then `git diff main bugfix -- <paths>` to confirm what is
   genuinely unabsorbed.
3. **Record the checkout's posture:** `git branch --show-current` and
   `git status --short`. A checkout sitting on `bugfix`, or dirty in
   `lib/`/`app/`/`packages/`/`plugins/`, silently poisons regens (it has
   happened — see §5.1) and flips the §1 regen rule to pin-required.
4. **Classify every new commit** — `git show --stat` for the file list,
   then the hunks. ⚠ **Never classify (or later port) from the commit
   message.** A v4 commit message describes the bug's shape as its author
   understood it; the shipped hunks are often narrower. The spec is
   `git show <sha>:<path>` (the post-commit file) plus `git show <sha> --
   <path>` (the hunks). When the message asserts a behavior change, find
   the hunk that makes it; if there is no such hunk, the claim is about the
   bug, not the fix (P4.D110/bug 96 is the canonical case). Carry a note of
   what a commit did NOT do into the row when the prose misleads.
5. **Delineate the intersection with ported work.** For each commit's
   files, name the v5 surface and the round/lane that ported it — grep
   `status-log.md` and CLAUDE.md's round bullets for the v4 path, feature
   name, or bug number. Rules of thumb: `lib/**` and `app/api/**` are fully
   ported (Phases 2–4); `components/**`/`app/**` client code maps to the
   SPA verticals; `packages/quilltap/**` is the CLI Tier R;
   `help/**` banks to `p4.9i2`; `.github/`, `docker/`, release scripts,
   and tests-only changes are NO-PORT candidates. Check v4's
   `docs/developer/bugs.md` for the bug number: a bug this port filed
   coming back fixed is a **CONVERGENCE** row (pins will trip; §5.4).
6. **Update §1 and §3** — never touch existing ORDERED/ABSORBED
   dispositions except to append newer facts. Commit per
   `.claude/commands/commit.md` (docs-only) and report: the verdict, the
   new rows, which ported surfaces are affected, and whether the regen rule
   changed.

## §5 Standing drift machinery — recipes and traps

_Moved into the repo from the session-memory notes, 2026-08-25. This is the
durable home; the memory notes now just point here._

### §5.1 The pinned-worktree regen recipe

A fresh oracle is only as pinned as the tree it imports. Whenever v4 HEAD is
past the baseline OR the checkout is dirty or on the wrong branch, regen from
a detached worktree pinned at the baseline. v4 is the human's active repo —
**never stash or checkout-switch it.**

```bash
PIN=/tmp/qt-v4-pin-<order>-<sha>       # LANE-UNIQUE path — never share pins
git -C ~/source/quilltap-server worktree add --detach "$PIN" <baseline-sha>
# THREE symlink classes, all untracked and absent from a bare worktree:
ln -sfn ~/source/quilltap-server/node_modules "$PIN/node_modules"
ln -sfn ~/source/quilltap-server/packages/quilltap/node_modules \
        "$PIN/packages/quilltap/node_modules"
for d in ~/source/quilltap-server/plugins/dist/*/; do
  [ -d "$d/node_modules" ] && ln -sfn "$d/node_modules" "$PIN/plugins/dist/$(basename "$d")/node_modules"
done
cd "$PIN"   # run EVERY tsx/jest oracle + fixture builder from here
# cleanup: git -C ~/source/quilltap-server worktree remove --force "$PIN"
```

- The `@/` alias resolves through the cwd's tsconfig, so cwd = the pinned
  worktree imports pinned lib code. The second symlink feeds the real-DB
  jest cases' `requireActual` of the cipher driver; the third feeds any
  oracle that loads a provider plugin (`provider-registry.ts`, the
  stream/envelope recorders, the manifest generator) — without it they die
  on `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/sdk'`.
- **The empty-file trap:** that failure is loud on stderr, but if stdout was
  redirected to the oracle file, the redirect already truncated it to ZERO
  bytes — the next diff then reads "DIFFERS against an empty file" exactly
  like real drift. Check the file is non-empty before believing a diff.
- **Verify the pin** by grepping the fresh NDJSON for a marker only one tree
  has (a sentence the drift added must be ABSENT from a baseline-pinned
  oracle).
- **Lane-unique paths:** a pin shared between lanes was deleted mid-run by
  whoever finished first (P4.d26) while v4 HEAD was past the baseline — the
  later regen would silently have used the wrong tree. Cheap guard:
  `git -C ~/source/quilltap-server worktree list` before each regen batch.
- **The checkout can go dirty MID-LANE** (P4.D105): clean at lane start,
  dirty two units later. Do not reason about whether the dirty files "could"
  have mattered — build the pin, re-run every regen the lane already did
  from it, and expect the re-run to change nothing. That is a cheap, total
  proof; the alternative is an argument.
- The pin is also what makes an end-of-lane sweep honest:
  `harness/tools/recipe_sweep.py --run-all --v4 "$PIN"` rewrites every
  recipe's `cd ~/source/quilltap-server`.

### §5.2 The silent-stale-pass trap (regen verification)

A fixture builder that ERRORS leaves the old fixture in place, and the
differential then passes **green on stale data** — the green comes from the
old fixture + old oracle agreeing with each other as they always had.
Discipline for every regen:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/qt-<x>.db                      # a failed build can't hide behind a stale file
... build ... 2>&1 | tail -1              # read it; a stack trace invalidates the run
grep -c '<new-field-or-id>' /tmp/oracle-<x>.ndjson   # MUST be > 0
```

Corollaries: a green regen is not coverage — grep every regenerated NDJSON
for the CHANGED bytes; when appending to a pinned-id corpus, check the WHOLE
id set for collisions, not the tail; anchor jest `--` filters
(`"case\.test\.ts$"`) because substring matches let a sibling case clobber
the same `QT_ORACLE_OUT`.

### §5.3 Commit prose misdescribes diffs

(Also in §4 step 4, because it bites at classification AND at porting.) Port
from the shipped hunks, never the message. Re-verify even when the work
order already flagged the trap — the order's paragraph is the same kind of
prose. Carry the finding into a v5-side code comment naming the sha and what
it did NOT do.

### §5.4 Convergence rows: measure, don't assume

When v4 adopts a fix this port made first, the both-directions divergence
pins trip at the baseline move **by design** — that tells you v4 MOVED, not
HOW. Regenerate the oracle and dump v4's ACTUAL post-fix output before
retiring a pin to a plain equality: v4's adoption is often partial or
differs in wording/details the planner never checked (P4.D51's bug-8 message
heads and bug-12 phantom-row surprises are the canonical cases). A partial
convergence splits one carve-out into a converged half + a still-divergent
half — expect to reshape pins, not just delete them. When a converging arm
reddens, instrument the harness to dump the actual rows (a `QT_DEBUG_*`
-gated `eprintln!`), and for restore/import read the archive's own manifest
as ground truth.

### §5.5 Drift heals real data — 💸 proofs expire

A banked live proof that depends on **damaged rows existing** can expire
because v4 (running daily on the real instance) lands its own fix and heals
the data — the orphan-reaper and poisoned-base-URL proofs both died this
way. When a round banks such a proof, record the measurement date and count;
before building a walk step around it, **measure the population first** (one
read-only query; a zero is a finding, not a failure); when it has expired,
retire it explicitly rather than carrying it forward. Planting the damage on
the disposable copy proves the mechanism but is a weaker claim — offer it,
don't silently swap it in.

## §6 History

- **The `0b0617fee` drift catch-up round (2026-09-03, baseline `6d2a50382` →
  `0b0617fee`):** `303288fb4` ABSORBED(p4.d148 server ∥ p4.d149 SPA — the
  create-time `conciergeState` through the existing `apply_concierge_flip`
  chokepoint on all three branches, the greeting ladder's attempt 0 on the
  uncensored desk asked WITH the chat row, the one shared desk closure; the
  New Chat dropdown + the omit-when-monitored body rule + the gated create-time
  beat flipped live at unification; Continue Elsewhere seeding recorded as a
  NO-COUNTERPART), `02d4efa1b` ABSORBED(p4.d150 — `distill_memory_search`
  takes the latency class, the fallback interactive, pinned at the real call
  sites by a budget-recording provider since the corpus is provably blind),
  `c9faa2c74` ABSORBED(p4.d150 — the inter-character timing debug line,
  capture-pinned three arms), `b448eddd7` NO-PORT-RATIFIED(p4.d151 — docs
  only, five files, zero lib/app/packages/plugins; its measurement
  obligations discharged by p4.d151 for bugs 116/118 and p4.d152 for 117),
  `0b0617fee` ABSORBED(p4.d151 bugs 116 + 118 ∥ p4.d152 bug 117 — the
  describer arrival verdict ahead of every content check with the
  `CompletionResponse.cache_usage` widening; the manifest regen proven
  byte-identical, v5 never had bug 118; the four bug-117 legs with the
  within-tree boolean comparand and the `realign-file-entry-sha256-v1` boot
  heal in the P4.D140 ledger shape, its presence-vs-drift stamp rule a
  RECORDED both-directions divergence). `15573c3a1` deliberately NOT swept
  (still §3). Round record: `status-log.md` → "Round record — the
  `0b0617fee` drift catch-up round unification".

- **The `6d2a50382` drift catch-up round (2026-09-02, baseline `4622411fd` →
  `6d2a50382`):** `70505745a` ABSORBED(p4.d146 — the presence gate at the
  three story-background sites incl. the reworded 400, the
  `backgroundDisplayMode` normalizer at the overlay parse + the narrowed
  update schema + the GET's dead arms deleted, the SPA card; the committed
  `cost-background` pair and the story builder widened so the gates can be
  seen), `a00e18f0d` ABSORBED(p4.d147 — v5 had NO folder picker; v4's
  post-fix `FolderPicker` built fresh over the existing verbs with the live
  beat), `a5df98b3f` ABSORBED(p4.d145 — the unique-constraint predicate,
  `ensure_by_path` over the seven create sites with the two private lookups
  deleted, the collapse-then-index boot ensure in the index-guarded idiom
  with NO ledger row, the restore quiet-drop arm + a new committed archive;
  the order's provisioning-hook suggestion REFUTED by measurement),
  `f3351d54f` NO-PORT-RATIFIED(p4.d143 — three files, zero lib/app),
  `c43d3b1b4` ABSORBED(p4.d143 server ∥ p4.d144 SPA — the derived
  `conciergeState`/`dangerCategories` pair on all four list payloads, the
  predicate delegation, the per-turn enqueue guard, the `has-dangerous`
  probe v5 never had; the presentation table once in the SPA, the mark, the
  pill, `shouldHideChat` as the one rule), `6d2a50382`
  NO-PORT-RATIFIED(p4.d143 — four version files). Round record:
  `status-log.md` → "Round record — the `6d2a50382` drift catch-up round
  unification".

- **The P4.D138 follow-up (2026-09-01, baseline unchanged at `4622411fd`;
  the LoRA train's three PARTIAL rows completed):** `84f33ce94`
  ABSORBED(p4.d138 units 1–4 + unit 6 ∥ p4.d139 — the read side landed:
  `list-models` `loraSupport`, the `options-schema` action, the NanoGPT
  detailed-catalog cache with the augmentation arm the unit-1 narrowing had
  named; the tripwire fired and was deleted; the two SPA beats live),
  `648d5c8aa` ABSORBED(p4.d138 unit 5 — bug 110's family-first `apply_loras`
  with the corpus re-recorded at the tip, exactly the two predicted rows
  moving; bug 111's error-level request log + v4's debug line, both
  capture-pinned), `2ece98c90` ABSORBED(p4.d138 unit 7 ∥ p4.d139 — the
  HuggingFace lookup + repo-id twins with a 57-row differential over v4's
  real modules, the `lora-metadata` action live behind an engine gate, the
  host transport; one recorded divergence, V8's own `SyntaxError` wording).
  Round record: `status-log.md` → "Round record — the P4.D138 follow-up
  unification".

- **The round-2 drift catch-up (2026-09-01, baseline `7fb668263` →
  `4622411fd`):** `5f56f7a7d` ABSORBED(p4.d142 — `.qt-range` + tokens
  byte-identical, all twelve v5 range hosts adopted, dogfood #107's
  `qt-markdown-field` rule, the host-class guard at the ordered NARROW
  scope + the `--self-test` landed at unification), `735d9408c`
  ABSORBED(p4.d140 — bug 112 whole: the `chat_activity` chokepoint with
  its tier-1 family, both write sites red-first, the six readers, the
  restore re-derive, the ai-import twin NO-COUNTERPART, the boot recompute
  heal in the P4.D97 ledger shape with its own family, the four SPA
  display flips, the e2e seed landmine repaired; plus the out-of-mandate
  `allowCheapFallback` P4.D135 remainder), `e41fcb12e`
  NO-PORT-RATIFIED(p4.d138 — CHANGELOG + two help files, +34, zero
  lib/app/packages/plugins; help hunks banked to `p4.9i2`), `4622411fd`
  NO-PORT-RATIFIED(the unify — `docs/releases/4.9.0.md` alone, +70/−6),
  `60e3c4a0a` ABSORBED(p4.d141 — the Concierge four-state whole: the
  predicate family reshape at every call site, the resolver's operator
  arms, the flips + writer sentences byte-exact, the `conciergeState` PUT
  arm closing v5's long-named deferral, the classifier-gate corpora that
  can finally see the gate, the SPA control + single-pill badge + client
  twin, the four-state walk live; the §3 review's sidebar-latch fix and
  the broken `post_office_writers_tier3` family repaired at unification).
  The LoRA train (`84f33ce94` → `648d5c8aa` → `2ece98c90`) is PARTIAL —
  the whole client half (p4.d139) + p4.d138 units 1–4; units 5–7 stay in
  §3 as PARTIAL rows and in the order's resume list. The §3 unification
  review (five parallel readers over six lanes) fixed six finding groups
  on the unify branch — headline: the Concierge select's permanent
  optimistic latch, the optimistic-bubble echo scoped across two clocks,
  and a harness family the kind rename had silently broken. Round record:

  `7fb668263`):** `1560bd43b` ABSORBED(p4.d134 — the Lima/WSL2 retirement
  whole: env/lock/CLI, the data-dir `isVM` wire deletion with two renamed
  deletion pins, the host-rewrite two-strategy collapse, self-inventory/
  almanack retirements, the SPA About/footer/profile mirrors; the grep
  census; the unported host gateway resolver named as a follow-up order),
  `7819afb1d` + `3c3432ae9` NO-PORT-RATIFIED(p4.d134, file lists in the
  lane record), `65f5021c8` ABSORBED(p4.d135 — provider/model fallback
  chains whole: the D23 re-dump with the generateDDL-position correction,
  the pure engine tier-1 at 155→158 cases, the Salon spine both
  entrances, cheap-LLM + image-description sites, both id-remap paths,
  the delete-nulls cascade with the updatedAt stamp, the SPA mirrors +
  the live understudy round-trip beat), `97ebfb9fc`
  NO-PORT-RATIFIED(p4.d136 — both bug files' v5-relevance columns quoted
  in the lane record), `a1d88aa3a` ABSORBED(p4.d136 — bug 106 proven
  red-first in both halves + the three-spellings consolidation; bug 107's
  budget rewrite with the latency class threaded from 45 call sites, the
  timeout-only retry, five of six handler guards [scene-state deferred
  loud], the C4 dogfood row superseded per §5.5; the outfit-consult
  bound inversion measured as v4's own and reproduced), `487ae16b1`
  ABSORBED(p4.d137 — bugs 108/109 red-first: the argument guards
  byte-exact, the fold module + rebuilt per-UTF-16-unit diacritics map,
  the 5/25 replay split executable), `7fb668263` ABSORBED(p4.d134's About
  rider; README/CHANGELOG_V4 remainder NO-PORT). The §3 unification
  review fixed four finding groups on the unify branch — headline: the
  `[CheapLLM] Task failed` warn fired AFTER the chain instead of before
  it (v4 warns first; the counter bug 107 was measured from would have
  under-counted). Round record: `status-log.md` → "The drift catch-up

  `execute_bug105_seed_abort`, the row's `import_aborts_on_non_string_
  provider` was its class description — is now a plain state-compared
  regression guard; the retirement measurably WIDENED coverage, the
  formerly-subtracted `main.image_profiles` table now discriminating),

  `b121ac77f` ABSORBED(p4.d133 — `instances restore-key` whole, Tier R
  188 → 212; the row's ⚠ scope question resolved at ordering — the write
  proved in-sandbox via `reset_live`, the real-pepper walk banked 💸; the

  chokepoint, the variable-limit chunking, bug 103's legacy profile-column
  seeding; a v4 REGRESSION found in `e000d6bfc` itself — the helper sits
  outside the per-item try, one malformed profile aborts a whole v4 import —
  pinned v5-side, filed upstream), `964ffb959` + `8872d7efc` + `21f573039`
