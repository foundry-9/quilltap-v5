# Feature: Per-Model Image Options + LoRA Support (NanoGPT first, generic by design)

**Status:** Implemented (v4.9-dev, 2026-08-29). Phases 1-5 landed; Phase 6
(dogfood proofs against a real NanoGPT key) is the one outstanding item — the
live probe of the flat-key passthrough has not been run, and the plugin's
request logger names every `lora_*` key it posts precisely so that run is
readable.
**Written:** 2026-08-29
**Provenance:** Research pass over NanoGPT's Image API docs, live model catalog, and
the NanoGPT web client's own per-model settings tables; codebase survey of the
Lantern image pipeline, the NanoGPT plugin, and the schema-driven provider-options
machinery.

## Summary

Give image profiles the same schema-driven per-model options the LLM connection
profiles already have, and add first-class LoRA support: a canonical
`loras: [{ source, scale }]` list stored on the image profile, edited in a dedicated
UI, and translated to each provider's wire dialect *by the plugin*. NanoGPT is the
first consumer (it hosts ~20 LoRA-capable image models today); the design is
deliberately provider-generic so ComfyUI (see
[comfy_ui_local_image.md](./comfy_ui_local_image.md)), fal-style providers, and
future OpenAI-compatible image endpoints plug into the same seam.

## Research findings: how NanoGPT does LoRAs

### The wire dialects (verified from NanoGPT's own client settings tables)

NanoGPT's generation endpoints accept **flat, model-specific body keys** alongside
the common fields (`model`, `prompt`, `n`, `size`, …). The docs already document
`guidance_scale`, `num_inference_steps`, `strength`, and `seed` this way on
`POST /v1/images/generations` ("model-specific generation controls"). The LoRA
fields are the same passthrough class. Three dialects exist across NanoGPT's
LoRA-capable models:

| Dialect | Wire keys | Max LoRAs | Model families (by id) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Indexed pairs** | `lora_url_1`/`lora_scale_1` … `lora_url_N`/`lora_scale_N` | 4: `flux-2-dev-lora`, `flux-2-dev-lora-image-to-image`. 3: the rest | `flux-2-dev-lora*`, `flux-2-klein-4b`, `flux-2-klein-9b`, `wavespeed-ai/flux-2-klein-base-{4b,9b}/{text-to-image,edit}-lora`, `z-image-turbo-lora`, `wavespeed-ai/krea-v2/turbo-lora` |
| **Single weights** | `lora_weights` (URL), `lora_scale`, optional `hf_api_token` (private/gated weights) | 1 | `pruna-ai/p-image/text-to-image-lora`, `pruna-ai/p-image/edit-lora` |
| **Single URL + strength** | `lora_url`, `lora_strength`, optional `lora_preset` | 1 | `flux-lora`, `flux-lora/inpainting` |

Details that matter:

- **URL values**: a `.safetensors` URL or a HuggingFace `owner/model-name`
  reference. NanoGPT's own hint text: "Path to the first LoRA model (e.g.,
  owner/model-name or .safetensors URL)."
- **Scale ranges**: wavespeed-family `lora_scale_N` is 0.0–4.0, default 1, step
  0.1. fal-family `lora_strength` is 0.1–4.0, default 1. pruna `lora_scale`
  defaults 0.5 (text-to-image) / 1 (edit).
- **`custom-civitai`** (runware engine) does LoRAs through CivitAI AIR
  identifiers baked into model selection, not through these keys — **out of
  scope** for this feature (follow-up candidate).

### Discovery metadata

- `GET /api/v1/image-models?detailed=true` (the endpoint the plugin already
  calls) returns per-model `tags` — **LoRA-capable models carry `"lora"` in
  `tags`** — plus `supported_parameters.resolutions`, `max_images`, and
  `capabilities.nsfw`.
- Neither the legacy listing nor the newer
  `GET /api/v1/images/models/{id}/endpoints` metadata advertises the LoRA
  request keys (`allowed_passthrough_parameters` is `[]` today). So **the
  dialect table above cannot be discovered; it must live in the plugin** as a
  static family map. The `lora` tag is still useful as the *capability* signal
  for models the static map doesn't know.

### Verification caveat (build this into the work)

The flat-key passthrough is proven for `guidance_scale`/`num_inference_steps`
(documented) and strongly evidenced for the `lora_*` keys (NanoGPT's own web
client sends them; the model pages render them as public generation settings).
It is **not** documented for the OpenAI-compatible endpoint the plugin uses via
the `openai` SDK. First implementation step on the plugin: a cheap live probe —
generate on `flux-lora` with a known-good public LoRA URL at scale 4 vs. no
LoRA, and once with a garbage LoRA URL (a processed-but-invalid URL fails
loudly; a silently-dropped key does not). If the legacy endpoint drops the
keys, fall back to raw `fetch` against the normalized `POST /api/v1/images`
route for LoRA-carrying requests only.

## Current state (the gaps this feature closes)

1. **`ImageGenParams` is a closed field list**
   (`packages/plugin-types/src/providers/image.ts`): `prompt, negativePrompt,
   model, size, aspectRatio, orientation, quality, style, n, responseFormat,
   seed, guidanceScale, steps`. No open-ended bag — unknown profile parameters
   can never reach a plugin.
2. **`mergeParameters` drops unknown keys**
   (`lib/tools/handlers/image-generation-handler.ts:246`), and the two
   background-job handlers (`character-avatar.ts:238`,
   `story-background.ts:637`) read only `parameters?.quality`. Four call sites
   build params independently (plus `app/api/v1/images/route.ts` and the
   wardrobe preview route).
3. **The image-profile options UI is a hand-written switch**
   (`components/image-profiles/ImageProfileParameters.tsx`) with hardcoded size
   lists per provider — exactly what the LLM side retired when
   `ProviderOptionsSchema` + `ProviderOptionsPanel` landed.
4. **The reserved seams for this feature already exist** in
   `packages/plugin-types/src/plugins/provider-options.ts`:
   `ProviderOptionField.appliesToModels` ("reserved for the model-keyed gating
   follow-up") and `ProviderOptionsSchemaContext.modelName` ("the seam reserved
   for a follow-up that will gate fields per model"). This feature is that
   follow-up, applied to images.
5. **Prior LoRA art**: `ImageStyleInfo` (`plugins/provider.ts:329`) already has
   `loraId` + `triggerPhrase`; the trigger-phrase half is plumbed end-to-end
   into prompt expansion (`image-generation-handler.ts:816-830`). Nothing
   consumes `loraId`. The ComfyUI proposal doc sketches `loras` as a repeating
   `{ name, weight }` list — requirements, not an interface (its
   `ImageGenPlugin`/`profileFields` vocabulary predates the real plugin API).
6. **The model-matching primitive exists**: the longest-prefix `matchModel` in
   `lib/image-gen/orientation.ts:67-81`, already used for per-model orientation
   support.

## Design

### 1. Canonical LoRA shape (provider-neutral, the single source of truth)

```ts
// packages/plugin-types/src/providers/image.ts
export interface ImageLoraSpec {
  /** URL to weights (.safetensors), an owner/repo reference, or a
   *  provider-scoped identifier — the plugin decides what it accepts. */
  source: string;
  /** Strength/scale. Omitted = provider default. */
  scale?: number;
  /** Optional trigger phrase injected into the prompt when this LoRA rides
   *  a request (reuses the existing styleTriggerPhrase plumbing). */
  triggerPhrase?: string;
  /** Display label for the UI; never sent on the wire. */
  label?: string;
}
```

Stored in the existing `image_profiles.parameters` JSON bag under the reserved
key `loras: ImageLoraSpec[]`. No migration, no DDL change; `parameters` already
round-trips through `.qtap` export/import and backups as an opaque bag.

### 2. Capability declaration (how the host knows LoRAs apply)

```ts
export interface ImageLoraSupport {
  maxLoras: number;
  scale?: { min: number; max: number; default: number; step?: number };
  /** What the plugin accepts in ImageLoraSpec.source. */
  sourceKinds: Array<'url' | 'hf-repo' | 'provider-id'>;
  /** Optional extra auth field (NanoGPT pruna family's hf_api_token). */
  supportsPrivateWeightsToken?: boolean;
}
```

- Per-model: new optional `loraSupport?: ImageLoraSupport` on the per-model
  info returned by `getImageGenerationModels()`.
- Provider-level fallback: `ImageProviderConstraints.loraSupport?`.
- Resolution mirrors orientation: exact id → longest-prefix family match →
  provider constraint → none (UI hides the LoRA editor; params builder strips
  `loras`).

**A plugin that declares no `loraSupport` never sees a `loras` key.** That is
the genericity guarantee: OpenAI/Google/Grok plugins change zero lines.

### 3. Open params channel

- `ImageGenParams.loras?: ImageLoraSpec[]` — the canonical list.
- `ImageGenParams.profileParameters?: Record<string, unknown>` — mirror of
  `LLMParams.profileParameters`, so schema-driven per-model options
  (`num_inference_steps`, `guidance_scale`, `lora_preset`, `hf_api_token`, …)
  reach the plugin without the host enumerating them. The plugin — not the
  host — decides which keys hit the wire (allow-list per model family, exactly
  the OAC applier precedent from the LLM side).

### 4. Plugin-side dialect mapping (NanoGPT)

`plugins/dist/qtap-plugin-nanogpt/image-provider.ts` gains a small static
family table (longest-prefix keys, mirroring the table in Research above) and a
`applyLoras(requestBody, model, loras)` step:

- indexed family → `lora_url_{i+1}` / `lora_scale_{i+1}`, capped at
  `maxLoras`, extras dropped **with a warn log naming the dropped sources**
  (the finding-#103 lesson: never drop silently);
- pruna family → `loras[0]` → `lora_weights` + `lora_scale` (+
  `hf_api_token` from `profileParameters`);
- fal family → `loras[0]` → `lora_url` + `lora_strength`.

The same body-assembly step forwards the allow-listed `profileParameters` keys
(`num_inference_steps`, `guidance_scale`, `steps`, `strength`, `lora_preset`,
`hf_api_token`) for models that support them. Extra keys ride the OpenAI SDK
call as extra body params (the existing `seed` cast pattern).

### 5. Schema-driven image options panel (retire the hand-written switch)

- New optional plugin hook, sibling to `getProviderOptionsSchema`:

  ```ts
  getImageProviderOptionsSchema?(
    context?: { modelName?: string }
  ): ProviderOptionsSchema | null;
  ```

  Same `ProviderOptionsSchema` type, same renderer. NanoGPT's implementation
  builds the schema **dynamically per model** from its cached
  `/api/v1/image-models?detailed=true` catalog: `size` becomes an `enum` field
  from `supported_parameters.resolutions` (same storage key as today, so
  existing profiles keep working), `n` bounds from `max_images`, plus the
  static per-family extras (steps/guidance for `flux-lora`, etc.). LoRA
  URL/scale fields are **not** options-schema fields — they get the dedicated
  editor (below), because they are a structured repeating pair, not flat keys.
- Serve it from `app/api/v1/image-profiles/route.ts` as
  `GET ?action=options-schema&provider=X&model=Y` (model optional), the same
  try/catch-wrapped pattern as `app/api/v1/providers/route.ts:31-52`.
- `ImageProfileForm.tsx` renders it with the **existing**
  `ProviderOptionsPanel` (it already takes `schema`, `parameters`,
  `modelName`, `onSetParameter` and contains nothing LLM-specific).
  `ImageProfileParameters.tsx` shrinks to: providers with a schema use the
  panel; the legacy switch remains only for providers without the hook until
  their plugins adopt it (OpenAI/Google can migrate opportunistically —
  Z.AI/NanoGPT's `SizeOnlyParameters` panels are subsumed immediately).
- While in there, implement `appliesToModels` gating in `ProviderOptionsPanel`
  using the `matchModel` longest-prefix matcher — it benefits the LLM side too
  and both seams are documented as reserved for exactly this.

### 6. LoRA editor UI

New `components/image-profiles/LoraListEditor.tsx`, shown in
`ImageProfileForm` only when the selected model resolves `loraSupport`:

- rows of (source text input, scale slider using `loraSupport.scale` bounds,
  optional trigger-phrase input, remove button); Add button disabled at
  `maxLoras`, with a count caption ("2 of 3");
- values persist to `parameters.loras` (canonical shape) via the same
  `setParameter` path;
- an over-cap state (profile saved against a 4-LoRA model, then switched to a
  1-LoRA model) renders the extra rows flagged, not deleted — switching back
  loses nothing (model switch deliberately does not reset `parameters`;
  provider switch already does).
- Use existing `qt-*` utilities; if any new `qt-*` class is needed, the
  theme-storybook mirror + publish gate applies (see checklist).

### 7. One params builder (fix the four-way drift)

New `lib/image-gen/params-builder.ts`:

```ts
buildImageGenParams(opts: {
  profile: ImageProfile;
  overrides?: Partial<ImageGenParams>;   // tool input / route body
  orientation?: Orientation;
}): ImageGenParams
```

- merges overrides over `profile.parameters` defaults (today's
  `mergeParameters` semantics, kept byte-compatible for existing fields);
- attaches `loras` (validated + capped via resolved `loraSupport`) and
  `profileParameters` (the residual bag minus host-owned keys);
- injects LoRA `triggerPhrase`s through the existing
  `styleTriggerPhrase`/prompt-expansion seam (multiple phrases join with
  `", "`, applied before expansion so the crafter sees them);
- adopted by all call sites: `image-generation-handler.ts` (both the main call
  and the Concierge reroute), `character-avatar.ts`, `story-background.ts`,
  `app/api/v1/images/route.ts`, `app/api/v1/wardrobe/preview-avatar/route.ts`.
  Without this, LoRAs work in chat and silently vanish for avatars and story
  backgrounds.

### 8. Validation

- Extend the image-profile POST/PUT handlers: when `parameters.loras` is
  present it must parse as `z.array(ImageLoraSpecSchema)` (new Zod schema in
  `lib/schemas/profile.types.ts`, exported next to `ImageProfileSchema`) —
  otherwise 400 `validationError`, nothing written (the P4.55/P4.D120
  guard-order lesson: validate before write, never silently keep).
- `source` must be non-empty; `scale` finite and within a permissive global
  bound (0–10) — per-model bounds are UI + plugin concerns, not storage
  concerns (a profile may be edited before a model is chosen).

## What this does NOT change

- No DB schema/DDL change (the `parameters` bag absorbs everything). No
  migration.
- No change to `generate_image`'s tool input schema — the LLM does not pass
  LoRA URLs; LoRAs are profile-level config (a per-character LoRA association
  is a named follow-up, below). Therefore no tool-snapshot churn.
- Existing profiles: untouched keys keep their meaning (`size`, `quality`,
  `seed` all keep the same storage keys under the schema-driven panel).

## Implementation plan (phased; each phase lands green)

### Phase 1 — plugin-types (⚠ publish gate)

`packages/plugin-types/src/providers/image.ts` + `plugins/provider.ts`:
`ImageLoraSpec`, `ImageLoraSupport`, `ImageGenParams.loras`,
`ImageGenParams.profileParameters`, `loraSupport` on the per-model info and
`ImageProviderConstraints`, `getImageProviderOptionsSchema` hook. Bump the
package version, then **stop and ask the human to `npm publish` before
installing** (standing rule; the publish gates the commit).

### Phase 2 — host seams

1. `ImageLoraSpecSchema` in `lib/schemas/profile.types.ts`; wire into the
   image-profiles POST/PUT validation.
2. `lib/image-gen/lora-support.ts`: `resolveLoraSupport(provider, model)`
   (exact → prefix → provider constraint), reusing/exporting `matchModel`.
3. `lib/image-gen/params-builder.ts` (§7) + adopt at all call sites; debug
   logs on every path (what loras resolved, what was capped/stripped).
4. `?action=options-schema` on `app/api/v1/image-profiles/route.ts`.
5. Unit tests: builder merge semantics (existing behavior pinned first),
   lora capping, trigger-phrase injection, validation 400s.

### Phase 3 — NanoGPT plugin

1. Static dialect/family table + `applyLoras` + `profileParameters`
   allow-list in `image-provider.ts`; `loraSupport` entries surfaced through
   `getImageGenerationModels()` (static families) and the `lora` tag from the
   live catalog for unknown models (capability only, indexed-dialect assumed
   only for known families — unknown LoRA-tagged models get capability
   **without** wire mapping and log a "family unknown" warn rather than guess).
2. `getImageProviderOptionsSchema` built from the cached detailed catalog
   (sizes, n, per-family extras). Cache the catalog fetch (TTL ~1h) so the
   settings UI doesn't hammer the endpoint.
3. **Live probe** (the caveat in Research): verify flat-key passthrough on the
   OpenAI-compatible route; if dropped, switch LoRA-carrying requests to raw
   `fetch` on `POST /api/v1/images`.
4. Unit tests: dialect mapping per family (indexed 3 vs 4, pruna, fal),
   cap-and-warn, no-`loraSupport` strip.
5. Bump plugin patch version (`package.json` + `manifest.json` if needed),
   `npm run build:plugins` (typechecks each plugin) before staging.

### Phase 4 — UI

1. `ProviderOptionsPanel` gains `appliesToModels` (prefix matcher) — shared
   with the LLM side.
2. `ImageProfileForm`: fetch options schema (provider+model keyed, refetch on
   model change), render `ProviderOptionsPanel`; `SizeOnlyParameters` retired
   for providers with a schema.
3. `LoraListEditor` (§6), gated on resolved `loraSupport` (the list-models
   response should carry the resolved `loraSupport` per model so the client
   doesn't duplicate resolution — extend `handleListModels`'s payload).
4. E2E beat: create a NanoGPT image profile against a seeded model list, add
   two LoRAs, save, reload, assert persistence and the cap behavior. (Fixture
   only — no live generation in the suite.)

### Phase 5 — docs + polish

- `help/*.md`: user-facing doc for image LoRAs + per-model options (steampunk
  voice; `url` frontmatter + In-Chat Navigation section matching it).
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (plain voice).
- Consider `qtap-export.schema.json`: `parameters` is already an open bag in
  the image-profile export shape — confirm, and add `loras` to any documented
  examples if the schema enumerates keys.
- Update [update-documentation](/.claude/commands/update-documentation.md)
  targets if any listed doc is touched.

### Phase 6 — dogfood proofs (real key, cheap models)

- `flux-lora` (~$0.035) with a public LoRA at scale 4 vs 0 — visible style
  delta proves the wire.
- `z-image-turbo-lora` (~$0.017) with 2 LoRAs — indexed dialect.
- A `generate_image` chat turn AND a story-background job on a LoRA-bearing
  profile — proves the shared builder reached the job handlers.
- The options panel on a real model list (sizes populated from the catalog).

## Implementation notes (as landed)

Where it deviates from, or sharpens, the plan above:

- **Trigger phrases are appended by inspection, not by a flag.** §7 proposed
  injecting phrases before expansion and letting the crafter carry them. That
  is still what happens — `classifyAndRouteForDangerousContent` folds them into
  `styleOptions.styleTriggerPhrase`, resolved against the profile that will
  actually generate (post-reroute) — but the builder then appends only the
  phrases the final prompt does *not* already contain. Threading a
  "did the crafter get them?" boolean through five call sites would have been
  wrong on the two paths where crafting is skipped (no placeholders) or falls
  back to plain substitution.
- **`hf_api_token` and `lora_preset` are not on the general passthrough
  allow-list.** The token is a credential; broadcasting it to whatever model a
  profile happens to name is not something an allow-list should permit. Both
  are attached inside `applyLoras`, where the dialect — and therefore the need
  — is known.
- **`ImageGenerationModelInfo` entries for the LoRA families are generated from
  the dialect table**, not hand-listed beside it. The table already owns which
  families take adapters and how many; a second copy would drift on the first
  cap change.
- **`matchModel` is exported from `orientation.ts`** rather than moved: LoRA
  support resolves exactly the way orientation does, and one matcher serving
  two capabilities is the point.
- **The E2E beat runs through the HTTP API**, not the profile modal. The form's
  model picker is populated from a live provider fetch and the suite
  provisions no NanoGPT key, so a UI-driven beat would assert against an empty
  picker. Everything the feature promises — canonical shape survives the round
  trip, malformed lists refused before any write, resolved cap matches the
  model — lives server-side.
- **Adopting the shared builder changed four call sites' behaviour on purpose.**
  Avatars, story backgrounds, `POST /api/v1/images` and the wardrobe preview
  now honour the profile's `negativePrompt`, `seed`, `guidanceScale` and
  `steps`, which they previously ignored; the wardrobe preview resolves
  portrait through the provider's own mechanism instead of a hardcoded
  `1024x1792` that only OpenAI ever accepted. That is the drift the phase set
  out to fix.

## Generalizing to other LoRA-capable providers

- **The canonical shape is the contract.** `loras: [{source, scale}]` maps
  1:1 onto fal's native `loras: [{path, scale}]` array, Replicate's
  `lora_weights`-style single fields, runware's AIR-referenced adapters, and
  ComfyUI's `LoraLoader` node chain. Each future plugin implements only:
  declare `loraSupport` (per model or provider-wide) + map the canonical list
  in its request builder. Nothing else in the host changes.
- **ComfyUI** (the existing proposal): its `listLoras()` idea becomes an
  optional future hook (`listImageLoras?(): Promise<{id, label}[]>`) that the
  `LoraListEditor` can use to offer a picker instead of a bare URL field —
  additive, not required for this feature. Its `{name, weight}` request shape
  is exactly `{source, scale}`.
- **OpenAI-compatible image endpoints** (SD-WebUI/Forge, LocalAI): most accept
  fal-ish `loras` arrays or `<lora:name:weight>` prompt tags; a plugin can
  even implement `loraSupport` purely as prompt-tag injection — the
  `triggerPhrase` field plus a `source`-to-tag mapping covers it without any
  new seam.
- **`ImageStyleInfo` unification (follow-up):** provider-curated named styles
  (`loraId` + `triggerPhrase`) can be re-expressed as preset `ImageLoraSpec`s
  offered by the plugin, collapsing two half-features into one. Not in scope;
  the trigger-phrase plumbing is shared already.

## Addendum: querying a source against HuggingFace (landed after the fact)

A LoRA row is free text, and the original feature posted whatever it was given.
The failure that motivated this addendum is the one the module comments already
worried about one layer down: a Flux 1 adapter on a Flux 2 model produces a
request that succeeds, an account that is debited, and a picture that ignores
the adapter entirely. No error, anywhere.

**Shape.** A **Query** button per row, backed by
`POST /api/v1/image-profiles?action=lora-metadata` and
`lib/image-gen/huggingface-lookup`. It fetches the repository's public metadata
and renders it in `components/image-profiles/LoraQueryResult.tsx`. The repo-id
parsing is split into `lib/image-gen/huggingface-repo-id` — pure and
dependency-free — because the editor decides in the browser whether a source is
even askable-about, and the lookup module imports the logger.

**The design decision worth preserving: it renders no compatibility verdict.**
The obvious feature is a warning when the adapter's `base_model` disagrees with
the selected model. It was considered and deliberately rejected. NanoGPT leaves
`allowed_passthrough_parameters` empty (see *Verification caveat* above), which
is why the family table is hand-maintained in the first place; a compatibility
check would mean matching NanoGPT model-id prefixes against HuggingFace
`base_model` strings, two conventions that answer to nobody. A false
"incompatible" on an adapter that works is worse than the silence it replaced,
and it would rot invisibly as either side renames things. The panel shows facts
and stops. A unit test asserts no `compatible` / `verdict` / `works` key ever
appears on the payload, so the temptation cannot be indulged quietly later.

**What the facts buy, beyond existence:**

- `cardData.instance_prompt` is the adapter's trigger phrase — exactly the field
  the row already has, and otherwise buried in a model card. One click fills it.
  This alone justifies the button.
- The `.safetensors` list: more than one file means a bare `owner/name` is
  ambiguous and the provider picks.
- `gated`: consequential, because only the pruna `weights` family has an
  `hf_api_token` slot. The panel says whether the *selected* model has anywhere
  to put one — a claim about our own wiring, which we do know.

**The 401 rule.** Unauthenticated, HuggingFace answers "no such repository" and
"private, and not yours" identically, on purpose. The lookup reports
`missing-or-private` and never upgrades it to `not-found`; `404` appears only
once a token has established who is asking. Pinned by test.

**Credential handling.** POST, not GET, because `hf_api_token` rides the body —
a credential in a query string lands in every access log on the way. The lookup
runs host-side so the browser never contacts HuggingFace, and the token is
logged only as `hasToken: true`.

**Staleness.** A row's result is cleared when its Source is edited, and results
are re-indexed when a row is removed. Facts about the previous address sitting
beside a new one would be worse than no facts.

## Follow-ups (named, not in scope)

1. **Per-character LoRAs** — `ImageLoraSpec[]` on the character, merged
   `[...profile.loras, ...character.loras]` at build time (the ComfyUI doc's
   requirement); needs a cap/priority rule and UI on the character editor.
2. **`custom-civitai`** — AIR-identifier flow (browse/verify CivitAI routes);
   different enough to be its own feature.
3. **LoRA presets** — surface NanoGPT's `lora_preset` values for `flux-lora`
   once there's a discovery source for them.
4. **v5 port note** — this lands on ported surfaces (image profiles, provider
   plugins, options panel). Keep the change well-shaped for the differential
   port: Zod-validated edges, fixed error sentences, the builder as one
   testable unit. The v5 drift catch-up will absorb it as a normal lane.

## Standing-rules checklist (for the implementing session)

- [ ] `packages/plugin-types` version bump → **human `npm publish` before
      install** (hard stop).
- [ ] NanoGPT plugin patch bump + `npm run build:plugins` before staging.
- [ ] All user-visible changes documented in `help/*.md` (with `url`
      frontmatter + In-Chat Navigation).
- [ ] `docs/CHANGELOG.md` entry (plain voice).
- [ ] Any new `qt-*` class → hand-written state variants in
      `_utilities.css` + theme-storybook mirror + package publish gate.
- [ ] Debug logging on every touched backend path.
- [ ] `npx tsc` (not `npm run build`) for type checks; lint runs the spelling
      sweep and the qt-class gate.
- [ ] No stubs/TODOs; validation before writes; nothing dropped silently
      (cap/strip always warns with names).
