# The Salon transcript as a subscribed read — demoting SSE to display-only

> **Status:** Implemented (2026-09-11). Phases 0–2 landed together; Phase 3's two defects are filed as bugs 135 and 136 rather than fixed here, as §5 directs. Deviations in §8.
> **Scope:** How a message — any message — reaches an open Salon tab. Today there is exactly one path, the read loop of the `POST /api/v1/messages` fetch, and it is both the transport *and* the authority. This plan makes the socket-hinted re-read authoritative and demotes the SSE stream to a display-only overlay for the turn currently in flight. The turn manager is untouched: people still take turns, and the server still decides whose turn it is.

## 1. The feature in one paragraph

The Salon's transcript is the last major read in the application that cannot be told it is stale. Messages live in a plain `useState` array (`app/salon/[id]/hooks/useChatData.ts:15`), filled once at mount from `GET /api/v1/chats/:id` and thereafter mutated only by the SSE read loop of whichever `POST /api/v1/messages` request the tab itself issued. Nothing else can add a message to the display — not a second tab, not a reconnect, not the forked child posting an Aurora wardrobe note or a Lantern backdrop. This plan inverts the authority: a chat-scoped realtime hint (`{topic:'chats', id}` — already published, see §3) triggers a re-read of the transcript through the REST API, and *that* is what the room is. The SSE stream keeps carrying tokens for the turn being generated, but it stops being how anything is *delivered*; it paints a provisional bubble that the authoritative read replaces. A dropped stream then costs a typing animation instead of a turn.

### 1.1 The incident that motivated this

Chat `9be06466…`, 2026-09-11, on a live instance. The operator sent a line through the new "In Their Own Words" review dialog. Server-side everything succeeded: the user message persisted at 12:49:25.818Z (`47a3a91d…`), the orchestrator selected Abigail as next speaker, and her reply persisted at 12:49:59.812Z (`71369b19…`) — a plain `ASSISTANT` row, no `systemSender`, no `targetParticipantIds`, fully renderable. **The reply never appeared in the tab.** It is still in the database, recoverable by reloading the chat.

No error was logged anywhere, and none could be: `safeEnqueue` swallows writes to a closed controller, so a client that has gone away is indistinguishable from one that is listening. The 34-second generation window, following a long human-in-the-loop pause in the review dialog, is precisely when an operator tabs away. Nothing existed to tell the tab to look again.

This is not a bug in the impersonation-voice feature. That path was verified argument-identical to a normal composer submit. It is a structural gap that the feature merely made easy to hit — and the same gap is why, as the operator put it, the incidentals are "very hit-and-miss beside the actual chat messages."

## 2. Design decisions settled (do not re-litigate)

1. **Hints stay hints.** This does not amend decision 1 of the realtime design. The socket carries `{v:1, topic:'chats', id}` and never a message body. There is no second serialization of a message to drift from the REST shape. This plan *extends the coverage* of the existing hint bus to a read that was left out of it; it changes no protocol.
2. **Token streaming stays on SSE.** Per-token deltas cannot ride a 250 ms-coalesced invalidation bus (`lib/realtime/bus.ts:43`) without becoming a refetch per token. SSE keeps carrying tokens, tool batches, `carinaAnswer`, and status events. What it loses is *authority*, not its job.
3. **The re-read is the source of truth; the stream is an overlay.** Rendering is: authoritative rows from the transcript read, plus at most one provisional in-flight bubble. The moment a persisted row for that turn arrives, the provisional bubble is dropped. This is the inversion — everything else here is consequence.
4. **Reuse the `chats` topic, scoped by chat id.** `REPOSITORY_TOPICS` already maps the `chats` repository namespace to the `chats` topic (`lib/realtime/job-topics.ts:106`) and `TOPIC_ID_FIELDS` already extracts the chat id (`:122`). A new `chatMessages` topic would widen the enum to buy nothing, because the client already narrows by id (`hooks/useRealtime.ts:119`). The cost — a Lantern backdrop hint also nudging the transcript — is paid off by decision 5.
5. **The transcript read must be conditional.** A hint-driven unconditional re-read of the whole transcript is the amplification trap: one busy turn fires wardrobe, backdrop, whisper and memory hints against a transcript whose individual Commonplace whispers run to 17 KB. The read answers "nothing changed" cheaply, so a hint storm costs round trips, not payloads.
6. **No new polling site.** Per the standing rule, the fallback is the socket's own reconnect catch-up — `useRealtimeTopic` fires its handler on socket open (`hooks/useRealtime.ts:122`), so a tab that slept re-reads for free. The next mount is the degraded-mode fallback. Do not add an interval.
7. **The turn manager is out of scope.** Speaking order, cycle bookkeeping, skip eligibility and the fairness pause are unchanged. This plan is about delivery, not about whose turn it is.

## 3. Architecture map (where things live today)

Paths repo-relative; line numbers as of the commit this plan was written against.

**The read model — the core problem:**
- `app/salon/[id]/hooks/useChatData.ts:15` — `const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([])`. **The transcript is not a TanStack query.** There is nothing to invalidate, which is the whole reason the Salon could not participate in the realtime bus.
- `useChatData.ts:21-70` — `fetchChat`: reads `GET /api/v1/chats/:id` (`:23`), takes `data.chat.messages` (`:28`), collapses swipe groups defaulting to the newest variant (`:46-58`), sorts by `createdAt` (`:61`), then `setMessages` / `setSwipeStates`. The whole transcript arrives embedded in the chat object.
- `useChatData.ts:86-95` — the precedent, and the proof the reasoning is already accepted here: the memory count subscribes via `useRealtimeTopic('memories', …)` with a comment describing this exact class of bug ("without a path by which the server can say 'this changed', the number … stays frozen at whatever was true when the tab opened"). This plan applies that same argument to the transcript.
- `app/api/v1/messages/route.ts:26-54` — `GET /api/v1/messages?chatId=` exists, returns every `type === 'message'` event with no cursor and no conditional. The Salon does not currently use it.
- `lib/query/keys.ts:34-54` — the `chats` namespace. **There is no `messages` key.**

**Delivery today — the single point of failure:**
- `app/salon/[id]/hooks/useSSEStreaming.ts:827` — the one `POST /api/v1/messages?chatId=` fetch; `:845-848` takes the reader and hands it to `readSSEStream`. This read loop is the only way a generated reply reaches the tab.
- `useSSEStreaming.ts:784-806` — the optimistic user bubble (`temp-user-${Date.now()}`), attributed via `findActiveUserParticipant` so the impersonation overlay is honoured (Bug 45). The `temp-` prefix is the dedupe seam §4.3 builds on.
- `lib/services/chat-message/orchestrator.service.ts:359-363` — `turnStart` carries the server's actual responder, correcting the client's `getFirstCharacterParticipant()` guess.

**Subscriptions that exist but do not help:**
- `app/salon/[id]/SalonView.tsx:286` — the Salon's only `useRealtimeTopic('chats', …)`. Its callback does an **avatar check and nothing else**.
- `lib/realtime/topic-map.ts` — `queryKeysForTopic('chats', id)` returns `detail` / `state` / `background` / `gallery`. No transcript key, because none exists.

**The publish side — mostly already done:**
- `lib/database/repositories/chats-messages.ops.ts:309` (`addMessage`) and `:374` (`addMessages`) — the single write funnel for every message in the system, already the chokepoint that maintains `messageCount` and the cycle bookkeeping (`:346-364`). **This is the natural publish site.**
- `lib/realtime/bus.ts:115-116` — `publishRealtime` is `if (IS_JOB_CHILD) return`. A call placed in the funnel is therefore correct in both worlds: it fires in the parent and no-ops in the child, so there is no double-publish to reason about.
- `lib/background-jobs/host/job-dispatcher.ts:529-531` → `topicsForWriteBatch` (`lib/realtime/job-topics.ts:169`) — **child-written messages already publish `{topic:'chats', id: chatId}` after commit.** Every Aurora note, Lantern backdrop and Commonplace whisper written from the forked child is *already announcing itself*. The hint is flying today and nothing is listening for it.

That last point is the good news: the "incidentals are hit-and-miss" half of this problem is a client-side subscription away from being solved.

## 4. The design

### 4.1 Publish

One call in the funnel, covering both `addMessage` and `addMessages`, plus the delete and update paths in the same ops module (a swept whisper and an edited row are transcript changes too):

```ts
publishRealtime('chats', chatId)   // no-op in the job child by construction
```

No change to `REALTIME_TOPICS`, `topic-map.ts`'s topic switch, or the envelope.

### 4.2 The conditional transcript read

Add `queryKeys.chats.messages(id)` and a read the Salon owns, then add that key to `queryKeysForTopic('chats', id)` so the existing hint drives it.

The open question worth deciding before implementation is **how the read answers "unchanged" cheaply**. The recommendation is a `transcriptVersion` integer on the chat row, bumped at the same funnel that publishes, with `GET /api/v1/messages?chatId=&knownVersion=N` returning either `{unchanged: true}` or `{version, messages}`. It is exact under appends, edits *and* deletions — which a naive `since=<timestamp>` cursor is not, and this transcript genuinely deletes rows (the Commonplace whisper sweep) and mutates them (swipes, regenerate, `dangerFlags`). Timestamps also tie in practice: this chat has message pairs 41 ms and 5 ms apart.

The cost is a column, which per the standing conventions means a migration (with its pretty-label and progress reporting), a [DDL.md](../../DDL.md) update, and a decision about whether it belongs in `.qtap` export (it should not — it is derived bookkeeping, and import should simply start it at zero).

Keyset pagination (`since=(createdAt, id)`) is deliberately **not** in v1. With a conditional read the common case is already cheap, and paginating a transcript that must also reflect deletions is a materially harder problem. Revisit only if measurement demands it.

### 4.3 Reconciling the stream with the read

The provisional bubble stops living in the authoritative array:

- Streaming content for the turn in flight is held in its own slot, keyed by the turn, not spliced into `messages`.
- Render = authoritative rows + at most one provisional bubble.
- The provisional bubble is dropped as soon as the authoritative read contains a row for that turn. The existing `temp-` id prefix and the `turnStart` participant id give the seam to match on.
- A refetch landing mid-stream must therefore be *safe*, which is the property the whole plan is buying.

Two pieces of state need explicit care, because today they are recomputed wholesale by `fetchChat` and would be yanked out from under the operator by a mid-turn refetch:

- **Swipe selection.** `fetchChat` resets every swipe group to the newest variant (`useChatData.ts:46-58`). A refetch must preserve the operator's current selection.
- **Scroll anchor.** Replacing the array must not jump the viewport.

### 4.4 What this fixes beyond the reported bug

- An interrupted or dropped stream no longer loses a turn — the reply lands on the next hint.
- Incidentals appear when they land, rather than only if they happened to be enqueued into an open stream at the right moment.
- The workspace's hidden, kept-alive Salon tab stays current instead of freezing at mount state.
- Reconnect after sleep re-reads for free (`useRealtime.ts:122`).

## 5. Phases

**Phase 0 — the safety net (fixes the reported bug on its own).** Publish at the funnel (§4.1); subscribe in `useChatData` with `useRealtimeTopic('chats', fetchChat, chatId)`. Two small changes, end-to-end correctness restored. Accepts an unconditional whole-chat refetch per hint as a known, temporary cost — and must ship §4.3's swipe and scroll preservation, because `fetchChat` now runs while the operator is mid-conversation rather than only at mount.

**Phase 1 — the conditional read (§4.2).** Retires Phase 0's amplification: `transcriptVersion`, the versioned endpoint, `queryKeys.chats.messages`, the `topic-map` row.

**Phase 2 — demote the stream (§4.3).** Move streaming content out of the authoritative array; make the provisional bubble a true overlay. This is the phase that actually delivers decision 3, and the one to take slowly.

**Phase 3 — cleanups this work exposes.** Two latent defects found while diagnosing the incident, both worth their own bug entries rather than being smuggled in here:
- `userStoppedStreamRef` is written in three places (`useChatControls.ts:171`, `:224`, `useSSEStreaming.ts:739`) and **never read anywhere**. Stop/pause is not gating stream processing at all.
- `useSSEStreaming.ts:735` silently `return`s when `sending` is true, with no feedback. A send swallowed by that guard is indistinguishable to the operator from one that failed.

## 6. Risks

- **Refetch amplification** — the reason §4.2 exists; Phase 0 knowingly carries it in the interim.
- **Mid-turn state churn** — swipe selection and scroll anchor (§4.3). The most likely source of a bad first impression.
- **Provisional/authoritative flicker** — the Bug 45 failure mode (bubble briefly attributed to the wrong author). Attribution on the optimistic bubble already goes through `findActiveUserParticipant`; the reconciliation must not regress it.
- **Ordering** — the authoritative read sorts by `createdAt`, and near-simultaneous staff messages tie. Whatever ordering the read settles on should be the one the client trusts, rather than a second client-side sort that can disagree with it.

## 7. Verification

- Unit: the funnel publishes for add/update/delete; no publish from the child (assert the `IS_JOB_CHILD` no-op holds).
- Integration: a hint for chat A does not refetch chat B; an unchanged transcript answers `unchanged`.
- **The regression test that matters, and the one to write first:** post a turn, sever the SSE stream mid-generation, and assert the reply still reaches the display. That is the incident in §1.1, and today it fails.

## 8. Deviations from this plan

Filled in on implementation (2026-09-11). Decisions 1–7 stand as written; the
phases landed as one change because Phase 0's amplification cost was never
worth shipping on its own once §4.2 was understood.

**1. No `queryKeys.chats.messages`, and no `topic-map` row.** §4.2 called for
both. The Salon's transcript is not a TanStack query and did not become one —
it is a `useState` array with a dozen imperative setters from the SSE path, and
converting it would have been a larger and riskier change than the delivery
problem warranted. `queryKeysForTopic` exists to translate a topic into the
TanStack keys it invalidates; a key no `useQuery` reads is a row that
invalidates nothing. The subscription is carried by `useRealtimeTopic('chats',
refreshTranscript, chatId)` in `useChatData`, exactly as the memory count
beside it already does — the precedent §3 cites. Revisit both if the transcript
ever moves onto Query.

**2. The transcript read is an `?action=` on the existing collection endpoint,
not a new shape for the bare `GET`.** §4.2 wrote it as
`GET /api/v1/messages?chatId=&knownVersion=N`. That endpoint already has a
consumer — the wardrobe dialog's default-character resolver
(`components/layout/left-sidebar/sidebar-footer.tsx:66`) reads its raw
`{messages}` — so the conditional read went in as
`?action=transcript`, per the house action-dispatch pattern, and the plain
listing is unchanged.

**3. The projection was extracted rather than re-implemented.** The plan did
not say where the transcript rows come from. The Salon's rows are not stored
events: they carry resolved attachments (uploaded files *and* Scriptorium mount
files), server-side pre-rendered HTML under the chat's template and typography
settings, and off-scene author cards for announcement and Carina bubbles whose
author is not a participant. Building a second copy of that in the new endpoint
would have been precisely the drift decision 1 exists to prevent, so the block
moved out of `app/api/v1/chats/[id]/handlers/get.ts` into
`lib/chat/transcript-projection.ts` and both readers call it. The chat GET also
now returns `transcriptVersion`, so the mount read seeds the counter.

**4. `offSceneCharacters` rides with the transcript.** Not anticipated by the
plan, and necessary: an announcement bubble or a Carina answer by a non-
participant has no avatar without its card, so a re-read that delivered the
bubble and not the card would render a blank.

**5. Provisional matching needed a second pass.** §4.3 proposed matching on the
`temp-` id prefix and the `turnStart` participant id. The prefix marks a bubble
but cannot match it to a row; role-and-text matching covers a plain line and a
pending tool row exactly, but *not* an attachment send — the bubble shows
`[Attached: plan.png]` while the server stores the bare prose, or "Please look
at the attached file(s)." when there was no prose. So a second pass matches a
bubble against a row of the same role that was not in the previous display and
is no older than the bubble. A bubble for a send that never persisted at all
(a 400, a chat that vanished) has no row coming and is swept by
`clearProvisionalMessages()` at the turn boundary.

**6. Swipe selection is carried by id, not index.** §4.3 required only that a
refetch "preserve the operator's current selection". Preserving the *index*
would move the selection whenever a regenerate appends a variant or a delete
removes one, so the selected variant's id is what is carried, with "newest" as
the fallback when that variant is gone.

**7. The scroll anchor is held by object identity rather than by measurement.**
§4.3 lists the scroll anchor as state needing explicit care. Rather than
capture and restore a scroll offset, `reconcileTranscript` reuses the previous
object for every row that did not change and returns the very array it was
given when nothing changed at all — so React bails out of the render and the
virtualizer never remeasures. The risk §6 names is addressed by there being
nothing to re-anchor.

**8. Ordering got a tiebreak (§6's fourth risk).** The display sort is
`createdAt`, then the row's position in the server's own response. Without the
second key a batch written in one call — which shares a timestamp outright —
leaves the client free to disagree with the read it just performed, and to
disagree differently on the next one.

**9. Two window events moved onto the cheap read.** `quilltap:terminal-exited`
and `quilltap:chat-update` in `SalonView` refetched the whole chat to pick up
one new message; they now call `refreshTranscript()`, which usually answers
"unchanged" because the write that raised them already published its hint.

**10. Phase 3 was filed, not fixed** — as §5 directs. Bug 135
(`userStoppedStreamRef`) and bug 136 (the silent `sending` guard).

### Settled in review (2026-09-11)

The first review round found the counter's concurrency, and the fix changed
where it lives. Recorded here because §4.2 describes only "an integer on the
chat row", and the difference is load-bearing.

**11. `transcriptVersion` is a column, but not a field.** §4.2's counter, read
into the chat entity and written with the rest of its bookkeeping, is not safe.
Every repository update goes through `_update`, which re-reads the row and
writes *all* of it back from that snapshot — so two messages landing together
both compute `snapshot + 1`, and a tab that read between them is afterwards told
"unchanged" and never shown the second. Any unrelated chat-row write (a pause, a
rename) can rewind it the same way.

So the column is deliberately **absent from `ChatMetadataSchema`**. Zod strips
what it does not declare, which means no `update()` can carry it and
`SET v = v + 1` — the atomic `$inc` in
`ChatMessagesOps.announceTranscriptChange` — is its only writer. Reading it is
`ChatsRepository.getTranscriptVersion`, straight off the row. Keeping it out of
the entity also retires the `.qtap` special-casing §4.2 anticipated: a field the
export layer never sees needs no omission, and an import starts at zero because
the column simply isn't in the bundle.

**12. The funnel was not the whole funnel.** `ChatSearchOps.replaceInMessages`
rewrites message rows directly, outside add/update/delete — a search-and-replace
would have left every open tab being told "unchanged" while the text under it
changed. It now announces like everything else, which is why
`announceTranscriptChange` is public.

**13. Version and rows are read as a pair, version first.** Both readers take
the counter *before* projecting. The pair must never claim a version newer than
the rows beside it, or the next conditional read answers "unchanged" for a
message the tab never received; too old only ever costs a redundant read. In the
chat GET this also steps around the terminal reconciliation and operator-mail
sweep, either of which can post a message after the chat row was loaded.

**14. A provisional bubble is retired only on the word of a read that came
back.** The turn-boundary sweep used to be unconditional, so a send whose
error-path read *also* failed lost the operator's only visible copy of a line
the server had in fact persisted. The sweep is now held over and performed by
the next successful read, after reconciliation has had its say.

**15. Provisional matching is bounded on both sides, and only new rows count.**
Both passes now require a row the previous display did not already hold — an
older identical line further up the transcript could otherwise retire a bubble
whose own row had not landed — and the clock-slack window bounds drift in either
direction, so a later turn's row cannot claim a pending bubble either. A
server-minted correlation id echoed on the stream would be stronger still, and
is the thing to reach for if this heuristic is ever observed to misfire.

**16. Swipe state keeps its object identity too.** Reconciliation returned a
fresh swipe map on every read, which scheduled a state update and undid the
no-render fast path the message array had just earned. It now hands back the
caller's own map when no group, selection or variant order moved.
