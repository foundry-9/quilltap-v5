# Bugs — defects surfaced by the v5 port

**Last Updated**: 2026-08-23
**Codebase**: Quilltap v4.9.0-dev
**Provenance**: the quilltap-v5 native port's differential harness, its
dogfood walks against a copy of real data, and — from Bug 62 — v4's own
feature-spec work and browser verification
**Status**: Bugs **1–97** are **fixed in v4**, and this catalogue currently has
**no open entries**. Bug 97 (filed and fixed 2026-08-23) is the catalogue's
clearest case of a fix promoting stale metadata into a defect: the OpenRouter
plugin declared `supportsAttachments: false` — honestly, before it could send
images — and bug 45 taught the provider to serialise `image_url` parts without
touching the declaration. Bug 91 then made that declaration load-bearing, and
the two halves of the same plugin began contradicting each other. Which half
won depended on runtime state, which is the part worth remembering: in
production the registry is up and the stale `false` won, so every OpenRouter
vision profile quietly degraded to the describe-fallback; in jest the registry
is down, the static mirror won, and the suite was green over behaviour
production never exhibited. A test environment reading the opposite branch from
production is not a gap in coverage, it is coverage that argues for the wrong
answer. The declaration now **imports** its MIME list from the code that does
the sending, and the new test reads the predicate with the registry initialised
and holds every bundled plugin's built declaration against the static mirror.
Bug 96 (filed and fixed 2026-08-23) is the smallest cause
in the catalogue with the widest blast radius: a cheap model answered
`needsNewTitle: true` and put the title under `suggestTitle`, two letters short
of the key being read, and the `undefined` that came back was coerced to `null`
and folded into the same branch as a genuine decline. The chat kept its generic
title, the checkpoint cursor advanced so the retry moved from interchange 7 to
10, and — the part nobody would predict from the cause — **the story-background
subsystem went dark for that chat entirely**, because
`queueStoryBackgroundIfEnabled` is called only from the rename-succeeded branch
and takes the new title as its scene context. Nothing failed: the job reported
COMPLETED, the LLM log held a well-formed verdict, the spend appeared in the
system events, and the cursor advanced exactly as a legitimate *no* would. It is
also intermittent — the same model titled three other chats correctly that
afternoon — so the feature looks like it works and never says when it didn't.
The parser is now shared by both title tasks, tolerates near-miss keys with the
canonical one winning, and **warns whenever it had to reach or came up empty**;
the residual coupling (a chat whose title is already good still gets no
background) is documented in the bug rather than silently fixed. Bugs 91–95 (filed and fixed 2026-08-23) are one session's
worth of a single subject — an image a user shared and no character could see —
and they are worth reading together, because four of the five are failures of
*voice* rather than of logic. **91** is the load-bearing one: one question was
asked where there were two. A profile's `supportsImageUpload` tick is a
truthful claim about the **model**, and four plugins (NanoGPT, DeepSeek,
OpenAI-Compatible, Ollama) strip every attachment before the wire regardless.
Either half alone is survivable — the first sends real bytes to a plugin that
forwards them, the second triggers the describe-fallback — but together they
cancel exactly: the fallback is suppressed *because* the model reads images,
and the bytes are dropped *because* the plugin cannot send them. The model
receives nothing and writes a confident paragraph about a picture it never saw,
which is the worst available failure mode because it looks like success. Both
authorities that knew better (NanoGPT's own manifest, and
`PROVIDER_ATTACHMENT_CAPABILITIES`, which had no entry for the provider at all)
were outside the code path. **94** is why it lasted: the plugin reported the
drop correctly in `attachmentResults.failed`, that object was threaded through
nine files onto the SSE `done` event, and no component ever read it — the
second field-with-no-reader in ten bugs, after 84. **93** is the same deafness
pointed at the provider: `glm-5v-turbo` said `finish_reason: sensitive` and the
Salon answered *this is a known issue, please try resending*, advice that cannot
work, for a cause the provider had stated outright. **95** is a good fix aging
badly — `normalizeWhisperRoles` re-roles Staff whispers to `user` for sound
reasons (bug 85), after which "the last message, if role is user" stopped
meaning the human's turn, so on any regenerate the image rode on a
connection-profile-change bubble while the Librarian's announcement insisted
the bytes were with the user's message. And **92** is the one that had been
visible for months without being named: a character's entire image vocabulary
was three *filing* verbs and no *looking* verb, so models reached for
`attach_image` to see a picture and were told to file it first — while a
3,427-character description of that very image, written by auto-describe two
minutes earlier, sat on the FileEntry with no tool able to reach it. `attach_image`
was kept and re-scoped rather than replaced; the gap was never that verb, it was
the missing one beside it. Bug 87 (filed and fixed 2026-08-22) was a NanoGPT turn
rendering its whole reply a second time inside a thinking fold anchored at the
end of the message: on some routed paths NanoGPT's gateway re-emits the
aggregated answer down the reasoning channel after the content stream ends,
and plugin 1.0.1's new — and correct — `delta.reasoning` read faithfully
recorded the echo as thinking. Token accounting proved it mechanical (746
completion tokens for a 2135-char reply, enough for it once, nowhere near
twice), and it is intermittent on NanoGPT's side — identical requests minutes
apart streamed clean. The plugin now holds post-prose reasoning while it is
still a verbatim prefix of the streamed prose: divergence commits it in full,
mirroring at stream end discards it. Bug 86 (filed and fixed 2026-08-21, a split-off from 85) was
the DeepSeek plugin deciding whether it was thinking by inspecting the request
body it was about to send, which answers "what did we ask for?" when the question
is "what will the model do?" — a V4 model with no `thinking` key reasons anyway,
so the params thinking mode ignores went out with it. Nothing errored; the plugin
README and the profile editor's help text carried the same misapprehension. The
predicate now asks the profile first and the model's `thinksByDefault` second,
the same order the host's evaluator uses. Bug 85 (filed and fixed 2026-08-21) was a
DeepSeek thinking model that greeted you and then 400ed on every later turn, with
an error text pointing squarely away from its cause: the message names
`reasoning_content` and history, but the culprit was the trailing assistant
`[Name]` prefill the multi-character anchor appends. DeepSeek's thinking mode
reads that as continuing an assistant turn and demands the reasoning that
produced it, which a synthetic prefill has none of. Laid beside the two
hostilities `lib/llm/multi-character-prefill.ts` already documented, it made a
point the individual entries did not: two of the three — Ollama's never-opened
reasoning block (bug 68) and this one — are *thinking* failures wearing a
provider's name, and only Anthropic's assistant-tail rejection is genuinely about
the provider. Hostility is now scoped to thinking-capable *models*: `ModelInfo`
carries `supportsThinking`/`thinksByDefault`, a provider plugin declares a
serialisable `thinkingTurnRule` naming its own option key, one pure evaluator
answers for host and profile editor alike, and a migration clears the stored `1`
on the rows the old blanket default wrote. A non-thinking DeepSeek or Ollama
profile keeps the prefill — bug 68's objection preserved rather than re-incurred.
Bug 84 (filed and fixed 2026-08-21) is a field with no reader: the SSE
emitter hoists a failing tool's human-readable sentence to `error`, a sibling of
`result`, *because `result` is null on failure* — and the Salon looked for it one
level down at `result?.error`, so a `generate_image` refusal that named its own
remedy displayed as `Unknown error`. One pure resolver now prefers the sibling,
keeps the nested read as a fallback, and strips the executor's `Error: ` wrapper
so the toast doesn't double it. Bug 83 (filed and fixed 2026-08-20) is the intermittent jest worker
SIGSEGV, misattributed for months to the native SQLCipher binding and finally
traced by a macOS crash report to an upstream V8 GC race
([nodejs/node#62393](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/62393)); the suite
now runs with Sparkplug disabled at two chokepoints, and the v5 side owes
nothing — Rust doesn't carry V8. Bugs 81 and 82 (filed and fixed 2026-08-19) both come of a request being
shaped by one answer where two were needed. In **81** the answer is a boolean:
`requiresApiKey` was asked both "must this provider have a key?" and "may it?",
and for OpenAI-Compatible — the one provider spanning an unauthenticated
llama.cpp and a hosted endpoint behind a bearer token — those answers differ, so
`false` was the only workable value and `false` removed the provider from the
Add-New-API-Key list and the profile form's key field alike. The repair is an
optional `acceptsApiKey` capability that means "same as `requiresApiKey`" when
omitted, read through one pure predicate on both sides of the wire; and the fix
had to reach further than the filing saw, because four server paths gated the
key *lookup* on the same flag and would have dropped an attached key even with
both UI gates open. In **82** the answer is a request shape: the context builder
emits up to three leading `system` blocks so a cache breakpoint on the first
survives churn in the others, which every hosted provider accepts and which the
Qwen family's chat template refuses outright — the greeting worked, every turn
after it died with a 500. The leading run is now folded at request-build time
for the two local builders only, behind a per-provider flag that defaults to
"leave it alone", so no hosted provider's bytes or cache breakpoints moved.
Bug 80 (filed and fixed 2026-08-18) is the workspace's arbitrated
backdrop meeting a view that was never converted to it: the project detail
still set `--story-background-url` on a layer that `.qt-workspace` hides, so
the "Latest chat background" setting painted nothing while the Prospero
subsystem image sat in the tab's registry slot. Bugs 78 and 79 (filed
2026-08-18, fixed the same day) are the same
sentence about two different columns: a value read back out of a loosely-typed
store was allowed to mean something it did not. In **78** `equippedOutfit` is
unconstrained JSON and the hair slot shipped on a deliberate no-migration
design — every slot key is `.default([])`, so a four-key legacy row is
*supposed* to read as `hair: []`. That holds wherever the value passes through
the schema, and `getEquippedOutfit` was the one place it did not: a raw cast,
after which the resolver indexed `slots['hair']`, handed `undefined` to
`expandComposites` and killed the avatar job on every chat older than the
feature — which is to say every real instance, since only fixtures are written
after it. The repair is a `normalizeEquippedSlots` chokepoint on the way out of
the column, which also heals the two sites that were degrading soft and quietly
dropping the character's clothes from the model's view; the resolver keeps its
`?? []` regardless, because it is exported and several callers hand it a bag
that never went near the repository. In **79** the value is a *fallback*:
`safeQuery`'s 4-arg mode answers a thrown read with `null`, and the import's
reconcile consumes that as "no such row" before committing a write — so a
destination that fails reads imports as an empty one, partially and
duplicated, and reports success. Editing the 23 nested read sites would have
meant re-deciding one question per site in files whose other callers still want
the degraded answer, so the fix carries the missing bit instead — *who is
asking* — as a `withStrictRepositoryFailures` scope around both import entry
points and a single `&& !strict` in `safeQuery`. The half the filing did not
anticipate: five importers had no `warnings` array at all and only logged, so
strictness alone would have traded a silent wrong branch for a silent skip;
they now name what they dropped, as does the preserveIds preflight, whose
refusal aborts the whole import and had been returning `success: false` with
nothing in it. Bug 76 (filed and fixed 2026-08-17) was Bug 73's shape one field over,
and the fix that closed 73 had gone straight past it: an api key chosen for one
provider stayed on the form after the provider changed, invisible on a keyless
provider and shown as blank on a different hosted one, while all four outbound
sites sent it on truthiness. The dialog said no key was selected while the wire
carried one, and the save was refused — correctly, server-side — with a
sentence naming a field the dialog does not show. The fix is the twin
chokepoint, `outboundApiKeyId`, answering the one question the truthiness test
never asked: *could the select show this id right now?* It refuses on both
counts the select can — a provider that renders no such control, and an id
outside the options it would list — which is the decision the base-URL fix
never had to make, and the half a user actually notices. Both of 73's
refinements carry across, plus a third of the same family: an api-key list that
has not loaded is no more evidence than an unloaded provider list, so an empty
one skips the test rather than stripping a working profile. Bug 74 (found 2026-08-16, fixed
2026-08-17) is the first entry here found by **v4 verifying its own fix**: two
404s sitting in the network log while the profile modal was open for bugs 72
and 73. Tagging a connection profile had never worked, three independent layers
deep — `TagEditor`'s `profile` branch called `/api/v1/profiles/<id>`, a route
that has never existed; behind that, the connection-profile GET had no
`get-tags` action and answered an unknown one with the whole profile body, so
the corrected path would still have read `data.tags` as `undefined` and shown
nothing; and behind *that*, `ProfileCard` read `tag.name` off
`enrichWithTags`'s `{tagId, tag}` envelope, so a tagged profile drew an empty
pill. The last two are one confusion twice — **two tag shapes with no owner** —
and are now settled by `resolveEditorTags`, a flattening of `enrichWithTags`
that both `get-tags` routes read, plus an `EnrichedTag` type that says what the
collection endpoint actually sends. The GET also refuses unknown actions now
rather than serving the profile, which is the leniency that hid layer 2 in the
first place. Bugs 72 and 73 (filed and fixed
2026-08-16) are both the profile editor failing to distinguish *shown* from
*sent*, and both were surfaced by the same dogfood walk over the bug 71
schemas — the panel's first contact with real hands. In **72** a numeric option
read its value straight off the parameter bag, so clearing the box deleted the
key, `fieldValue` fell back to `field.default`, and the default repainted over
the empty box with the caret behind it: clear `300`, type `5`, store `3005`.
`NumberField` now owns a draft string, with a `syncedFrom` companion telling its
own echo from an outside change — the naive re-sync-on-prop-change spelling
reintroduces the bug for any field that had a stored value before the clear.
The draft alone leaves the second consequence live, because a fresh mount still
seeds from `fieldValue`'s fold-in of the default; so `fieldValue` now returns
`undefined` for number fields and the default renders as the `placeholder`,
which is what finally makes *"leave blank for the default"* a state the user
can see themselves reaching, on first open as well as after a clear. In **73** the Base URL box is gated
on `requiresBaseUrl`, but all four outbound sites sent the value on truthiness
— so a passing glance at Ollama left `http://localhost:11434` clinging
invisibly to a profile that then could not connect, with no gesture available to
clear it. A new `outboundBaseUrl` chokepoint returns `''` for any provider the
plugin list says takes none — and, deliberately, *not* for a provider the list
does not know, since an unloaded or failed provider fetch must not read as
"clear this profile's URL". The save body drops its `if (baseUrl)` guard and
sends the empty string, because omitting the key leaves the PUT's
`baseUrl !== undefined` gate untripped and every already-poisoned row broken
forever. `handleProviderChange` is deliberately untouched — the value stays in
form state, inert rather than destructive, and returns if the user switches
back. Bug 71
(filed and fixed 2026-08-15 while benchmarking `Qwen3.8-27B` on an M4 Pro) was
the general case of the problem
[Bug 68](bugs/fixed/bug-68-ollama-prefill-kills-thinking.md) solved one instance
of: the two local-model providers had no route for a provider-specific request
parameter. `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE` never read `profileParameters` at all and
declared no options schema; `OLLAMA` read three keys and hardcoded the rest of
its `options` literal. Because the `parameters` column is free-form JSON that
accepts and persists anything, a key a user added saved cleanly, reloaded
cleanly, and was dropped on the way to the wire in silence — so no local model
could be run at its own publisher's recommended sampling settings, and
`reasoning_effort` was unavailable on exactly the providers where wall-clock
control matters most. The mechanism landed as an **exported helper**
(`applyProfileParameters`, plugin-utils 2.3.0) rather than a base-class method,
because measuring the graph disproved the obvious design: DeepSeek is the *only*
subclass of `OpenAICompatibleProvider`, while Z.AI and OpenRouter implement
`TextProvider` directly. Both local plugins now declare allow-lists, OAC gained
its first options schema (with `reasoning_effort` folded into
`chat_template_kwargs`, which is how `llama-server` reaches a template's
arguments), and Ollama gained per-profile `keep_alive` and thinking-effort —
both settled by measurement against a live Ollama 0.32.1 rather than by
assumption, which is what established that `keep_alive: "-1"` is refused as a
duration while the number is honoured. Carried in the same entry:
`OPENAI_COMPATIBLE` could never call a tool, blocked twice over. The `false`
capability is correct for an arbitrary endpoint and stays; what the fix removed
is that it was a ceiling — the body builds now carry `tools` and parse
`tool_calls` back. (One claim in the filing did not survive contact: the profile
editor was already seeding `allowToolUse` on new profiles only, and the checkbox
had never been disabled, so there was no clamp to remove.) Bug 69
(filed and fixed 2026-08-14) was found *while verifying* the bug 66 fix, which
needed an archived character to look at: the file watcher re-derives every
changed file's `sha256` from its bytes on disk, and an archived character's
bundle row deliberately records the digest of the **decrypted** bundle while the
disk bytes are encrypted. Seconds after every archive the watcher replaced the
content digest with a ciphertext one, and each later rehydrate refused the
bundle as corrupt — archiving had become one-way. A new
`lib/file-storage/digest-policy.ts` is now the one place that says which rows'
digests may be re-derived from disk (the watcher and the boot reconciliation
both ask it), and `restoreArchiveBundle` self-heals a row already clobbered when
the recorded digest is provably the digest of the file as stored. Bugs 66 and
67 (both filed 2026-08-14 by the v5 port's help-drift round — 66 from the
archive beats' live run, 67 from the composer-toolbar lane's send-path survey)
were fixed the same day: 66 by projecting `archivedAt` in
`getCharacterDetail`'s **two** return paths, so the chat GET the sidebar renders
from carries the archive tombstone on a fresh load — and, once a live check
showed the badge still dark, in the client's own `useParticipants` rebuild,
which had been dropping it again (so the badge could not light on *any* path,
not merely the first load the filing describes); 67 by moving "which composer surface is authoritative" into
one place — new `app/salon/[id]/composer-source-mode.ts` — so a send from the
raw-Markdown view ships the textarea's bytes rather than the suspended editor
handle's pre-toggle document, and the Send button follows the visible surface.
(One claim in 67's filing did not survive contact: Send *did* light for
source-typed text, because the textarea's `onChange` runs the page's `setInput`,
which maintains the flag; the discarded bytes are exactly as filed.) Bug 65
(filed and fixed 2026-08-13, noticed while verifying bug 64 on a fresh
instance): the version guard had been silently inert since 2026-08-12.
`version-guard.ts` reached into `migrations/lib/database-utils` with a
synchronous `require()`, and that module became an **async module** in
Turbopack's graph when the bug 58 fix added a static `instance-lock` import to
it — a sync `require()` of an async module returns an exports object that is
never populated, so every call threw `isSQLiteBackend is not a function` into a
catch that allowed startup anyway. `highest_app_version` was never stored and
`minServerVersion` never reached `.dbkey`, so an older binary would open a
newer database without complaint. Both functions are now `async` and use
`await import`; failures are announced through the migration-warnings channel
instead of dying in the log; a `no-restricted-syntax` rule fails the build on
the next sync `require` of `migrations/` from app code; and the tests assert
the *effect* rather than the absence of a throw. Bug 64
(filed and fixed 2026-08-13, from dogfooding a fresh Docker instance):
first-run encryption setup closed the main SQLite client out-of-band, but the
backend and manager singletons kept the dead handle cached — every repository
call failed with `The database connection is not open` until the process was
restarted. Teardown now runs through new `suspendDatabase()` /
`resumeDatabase()` chokepoints that recycle every handle while keeping the
backend instance (a rebuilt backend would drop the `ensureCollection` column
maps that live repositories never re-register), all three databases are
converted, and auto-lock got the same treatment. Bug
63 (filed and fixed 2026-08-13): text replacements fired inside fenced code
blocks and inline code; both the replacement plugin and the emoji typeahead
now share a `$isInCodeContext` guard. Bug 62 (filed and fixed
2026-08-13): the fallback roleplay dialogue pattern and dialogue detection both
spelled their "straight and curly" quote sets with the straight quote
duplicated, so curly-quoted dialogue had never been highlighted in any chat that
falls through to the defaults. Found while spec'ing
[composer-smart-typography](features/composer-smart-typography.md), which curls
quotes upstream of the roleplay layer and was therefore blocked on it; that
spec is now **unblocked**. Both defaults now carry the real curly code points
as `“` / `”` escapes, with fallback-path regression coverage on the
server *and* client renderers. Bug 61 (filed and fixed
2026-08-12 by the v5 port while deflaking its wardrobe e2e walk: an outfit edit
staged in the in-chat Wardrobe dialog before the worn snapshot arrives was
discarded, and the dialog closed as though it saved) is fixed by recording the
pre-snapshot gestures and **replaying them onto the snapshot** when it lands —
preserving the staged slots alone would have committed a hat and nothing else —
plus a flush that tells "nothing changed" from "we never learned what clean
was". It is **Owed** to the v5 side as a drift catch-up. Bug 57 (filed and
fixed 2026-08-11 by the v5 port's round-2 unification: the preserveIds preflight
refused a rehydrate bundle whose store carries one blob linked at two paths —
the per-link export duplication meeting an undeduped `carriedBlobIds`) converges
v4 onto the dedupe v5 had been carrying as a pinned divergence. Bug 56 came out of
dogfooding under Docker: folder creation in a filesystem store ran a recursive
`mkdir` without first checking the store's own base path existed. Bugs 52–55 all
came out of the character-archive work: 52 (cross-instance character imports
lost the vault and dangled the avatar id) was fixed 2026-08-10 by WP A2's
vault-carrying export; 53 (reconciliation clobbering and deleting archive
bundle rows), 54 (rehydrate refusing any character who shared a content row
with another vault) and 55 (a file row that outlived its bytes serving 500
instead of 404) were all found and fixed the same day, 54 and 55 by dogfooding
the merged feature on real data. Bug 51 (chat GET omitting
impersonation state, so a reload showed an impersonated seat as not impersonated)
was found and fixed 2026-08-08 while verifying Bug 50. Bugs 47–49 — the Brahma Console
giving up silently when its turn budget is exhausted, and two sibling
impersonation turn/speaking-as facets (impersonating does not hand the character
the current turn; the speaking-as seat does not follow the current user-driven
turn), all surfaced on the 2026-08-08 v5 dogfood walk — were fixed 2026-08-08.
Bug 50 (found the same day dogfooding a real roleplay: with two user-driven seats
and a single LLM, that LLM answered every human turn) was fixed 2026-08-08 too.
Each is **Owed** to the v5 side as a drift catch-up (the fixes move the oracle
baseline; Bug 47 also retires `dogfood-findings.md` #73).

**This page is the index.** Every bug lives in its own file under
[`bugs/`](bugs/); what stays here is the [Status](#status) table that points at
them and the cross-cutting v5-coordination notes.

---

## How these are filed

- **One bug, one file.** An open bug is
  `docs/developer/bugs/bug-<n>-<short-title>.md`; once its fix has landed in v4
  the same file moves to `docs/developer/bugs/fixed/`. `<short-title>` is a two-
  or three-word dashed description of the *problem*
  (`bug-9-store-delete-orphans.md`), enough to tell the files apart in a
  directory listing.
- **Numbers are permanent and sequential.** A bug keeps its number forever,
  including when it moves into `fixed/`. A new bug takes the next unused number.
- **Every file opens with a metadata table** — Status, Found, Fixed, Severity,
  Who it bites, Provenance, Fix site, v5 status, and a link back to this index —
  followed by the entry proper: symptom, root cause with file and line, why it
  survived, the fix, and how to verify it.
- **The [Status](#status) table here is the register.** Filing a new bug means
  writing the file *and* adding its row. Fixing one means `git mv`-ing the file
  into `fixed/`, filling in the Fixed date, fix site and v5 status in **both**
  the file's metadata table and its row here, and leaving a
  **`FIXED in v4 (date)`** paragraph at the top of the entry as the account of
  what was actually done.
- **Nothing is deleted.** Fixed entries keep their full root-cause write-up —
  they are the record of why the code looks the way it does, and the v5 port
  reads them.

## What this file is

The v5 port runs every ported unit against v4's **real** `lib/` code and diffs
the results field by field. That process occasionally finds a defect in v4
itself — a case where v5 and v4 disagree and **v4 is the one that is wrong**.

Those are recorded here with a fix plan — **one file per bug**, indexed by the
[Status](#status) table below. Each entry states the symptom, the root cause
with file and line, why it survived this long, the fix, and how to verify it.

**These are bugs, not preferences.** They are distinct from the port's much
longer list of *v4-faithful papercuts*, where v5 reproduces a v4 annoyance
exactly and any change is a product decision to be made in v4 first. That list
lives in the v5 repo (`docs/developer/porting/dogfood-findings.md`, "post-5.0
product improvements"). Nothing here is a matter of taste.

**Scope note:** this file was opened to plan the fix for **Bug 4** (the 3 MB
import bug). Bugs 1–3 come from the same audit, are listed first because they
are more urgent, and are included so the backup/restore family can be fixed in
one pass rather than three.

**Fix plan (historical):** bugs 8–43 were batched into nine session-sized,
dependency-ordered specs under [bugfix-sessions/](bugfix-sessions/README.md).
All nine have been executed; the specs are kept for the record.

## Provenance — Pinned, Faithful, Inert

Bugs 8 onward were surfaced by the port **after** Bugs 1–7 were fixed. The same
discipline applies throughout this catalogue: these are **bugs, not
preferences** — cases where v5 and v4 disagree and v4 is wrong, or
where v4 carries dead/broken code that silently does nothing (or the wrong
thing). The purely-taste items (a colour you'd prefer, a default you'd change)
are **not** here; they live on the v5 repo's "post-5.0 product improvements
(v4-first)" list.

Provenance is mixed. Many come from the differential harness *and are pinned in
both directions* — v5 has already taken the fix, and a v5 test asserts both "v5
is right" and "v4 is still wrong", so the day v4 converges the pin trips and
tells the v5 side to retire it. Those are flagged **Pinned**. Others were found
only by a human dogfooding real data (the harness cannot find a bug v5 reproduces
faithfully); those are flagged **Faithful** — v5 mirrors the defect exactly, so
the two sides must move together when v4 is fixed. A handful are **Inert**: dead
or unreachable code in v4 that costs no user anything today, recorded only so a
future reader does not "correct" the faithful port toward v4's broken original.

> **The coordination rule from Bugs 1–7 still holds.** A `lib/` fix here moves

## The constraint that shapes the sequencing

**v4 is the oracle for the v5 port.** The port pins an oracle baseline commit
and regenerates its fixtures from it; changing v4's `lib/` moves that baseline
mid-flight and obliges a v5 drift-catch-up round.

Consequences:

- **Do not land these quietly.** Coordinate with the v5 side: a `lib/` change
  here is drift debt there. (A docs-only commit — including this file — is not:
  the port dispositions docs-only v4 commits as no-debt.)
- **Fixing v4 will turn parts of the v5 harness RED, by design.** v5 already
  diverges from v4 on all four bugs, and those divergences are asserted in
  **both** directions so that an upstream fix cannot pass unnoticed. When these
  land, the v5 side must retire the corresponding tripwires:

  | v4 fix | v5 tripwire that fires | Expected message |
  |---|---|---|
  | Bugs 1–3 | `crates/quilltap-harness/tests/system_restore_state.rs` → `assert_divergences` | *"v4 restored N rows from an archive that carries them — the v4 bug this differential pins has been FIXED upstream; re-rule the divergence"* |
  | Bug 4 | `crates/quilltap-harness/tests/system_import_equivalence.rs` → `EXPECTED_DIVERGENCES` | the `throw_ndjson_truncated_blob` case stops diverging; remove it from the list |

  A red differential after these land is **the tripwire working**, not a
  regression. The v5 work is to delete the divergence entries and let the cases
  become plain equalities.

**Suggested order:** one branch, bugs 1–3 in a single commit (they are one
repair), bug 4 in a second. Land both at a point where the v5 side is between
rounds, so the baseline moves once.

That module became an async module in Turbopack's graph when `02821db6` (the bug 58 fix) added a static `instance-lock` import to it, and a sync `require()` of an async module returns an exports object that is never populated — measured empty even a microtask later, while `await import()` of the same specifier returns all twelve exports. Every call throws `isSQLiteBackend is not a function` into a catch that allows startup anyway, so `highest_app_version` is never stored (V4test has no row; Friday is frozen at `4.8.0`) and `minServerVersion` never reaches `.dbkey` | `lib/startup/version-guard.ts` (both functions async, `await import`, failures announced through the migration-warnings channel) + `instrumentation.ts` call sites + an `eslint.config.mjs` `no-restricted-syntax` rule banning sync `require` of `migrations/` from app code; **not** by unwinding the import edge in `database-utils.ts`, which would have left the next static import free to break it again | Design note: port the version-floor *behaviour* from the bug file, not from v4's code — v4's had never actually run |

Reproduced against `localhost:11434`: same 27B, no prefill → 470 thinking chars, with prefill → 0. Ollama-only — other providers carry a protocol-level reasoning field that survives the prefill (DeepSeek 1742/5689 multi-char turns, Ollama 0/12) | The route is now the user's choice per profile: `connection_profiles.multiCharacterPrefill` (migration `add-profile-multi-character-prefill-field-v1`, backfilled Anthropic-off/rest-on) resolved through the one chokepoint `profileUsesNamePrefill` in new `lib/llm/multi-character-prefill.ts`, applied by `applyMultiCharacterTurnAnchor` in `context-builder.service.ts` with the provider hardcoding removed, and surfaced as a profile-editor checkbox. A NULL column means "never chosen" and resolves to the provider default, so a pre-4.9 Anthropic import can't come back with the prefill on.

The small one won where it hurts — `remainingBudget` left ~1–1.5k tokens for 4897 tokens of history, silently trimmed every turn, while compression correctly saw no need to compress and the pre-send warning validated against the same corrupt figure. Two adjacent gaps fixed alongside: the builder packed to `totalLimit − responseReserve` while the validator warned 10% lower, and the tool schemas (never in the message array) plus the post-build agent-mode / tool-change injections were spent unbudgeted and uncounted | new `resolveContextWindow` chokepoint in `lib/llm/model-context-data.ts` honoured by `getRecommendedContextAllocation` / `getSafeInputLimit` / `calculateMaxAvailable`, with `calculateContextBudget` (`lib/chat/context-manager.ts`) now taking the profile and `buildContext` passing it; `computeSafeInputLimit` as the single ceiling both sides read; new `lib/services/chat-message/turn-extras.ts` (`collectTurnExtras`) building, measuring and reserving the payload's non-context parts | Not yet assessed — any v5 budget resolving the window from the model name inherits it |

The emitter hoists the text to a sibling of `result` *because `result` is null on failure* and says so in its comment; `trackToolResult` destructures only `{index, name, success, result}` and reads `result?.error`, one level too deep, so the fallback fires every time | `resolveToolResultErrorText(...)` in `app/salon/[id]/hooks/useSSEStreaming.ts` — reads the sibling `error` first, falls back to `result?.error`, and strips the executor's leading `Error: `; `trackToolResult`'s `generate_image` failure branch renders it into both the notice and the toast | Owed — v5 reproduces it exactly (`chat-stream.reducer.ts:379`, `salon-conversation.ts:2947`) and now absorbs the fix in a drift catch-up. v5 dogfood finding #99 |

The message misleads — it is not about history. The multi-character anchor appends a trailing assistant `[Name]` prefill, DeepSeek's thinking mode reads that as continuing an assistant turn and demands the reasoning that produced it, and a synthetic prefill has none. `isMultiCharacterChat` counts a single AI seat, so every character chat is affected; the greeting escapes only because it applies no anchor | Prefill-hostility scoped to **thinking-capable models, not providers**. `ModelInfo.supportsThinking`/`.thinksByDefault` + `TextProviderPlugin.thinkingTurnRule` (`@quilltap/plugin-types` 2.5.8); one pure evaluator in `lib/llm/thinking-turn.ts` run by both the host (`providerRegistry.profileRunsThinkingTurn`) and the profile editor — which is why the hook is a serialisable *rule* rather than the predicate function the filing proposed; `defaultMultiCharacterPrefill(provider, runsThinkingTurn)`; declarations in `qtap-plugin-deepseek` 1.0.20 and `qtap-plugin-ollama` 1.0.45 only, where the hostility is observed; migration `retire-prefill-on-thinking-profiles-v1` clears the stored `1`.

A V4 profile with `parameters: '{}'` sends no `thinking` key and reasons anyway, so `stripThinkingIncompatibleParams` never runs and `temperature`/`top_p`/the penalties go out on a request that ignores them. The plugin README and the profile editor's help text carried the same misapprehension, documenting thinking as a `deepseek-v4-pro` feature | `willRunThinkingTurn(body)` (`qtap-plugin-deepseek` 1.0.21) asks the profile's explicit choice first, then the model's `thinksByDefault` from `STATIC_MODELS` — the same order as the host's `evaluateThinkingTurn`.

Plugin 1.0.1's new — and correct — `delta.reasoning` read faithfully accumulated it, and core anchored it at the end of the prose as a thinking segment. Intermittent on NanoGPT's side: identical requests minutes apart streamed clean | `streamMessage` holds post-prose reasoning in a `pendingReasoning` buffer while the run is still a verbatim prefix of the streamed content — divergence commits it in full, mirroring at stream end discards it from yields, final chunk, and `rawResponse`; `sendMessage` drops `message.reasoning` equal to `message.content` (`qtap-plugin-nanogpt` 1.0.2) | Not investigated — any v5 NanoGPT transport reading `delta.reasoning` inherits it |

Worse on the default path: the subject came from `character.pronouns?.subject \|\| 'they'` against verbs conjugated for a singular, so every character with no pronouns recorded — the default state — ended its prompt on "**they CALLS them** — they does not merely describe calling them". Neither was a decision: `3f4d7a78a` introduced the block with `his/her` placeholders, and `11c4d6c2d` swapped in real pronouns while *the same commit* added the second-person preamble, manufacturing the disagreement. A unit test asserted the broken string, so any accidental fix would have failed CI | Both builders (`lib/chat/context/system-prompt-builder.ts` and its hand-copied twin `lib/help-chat/system-prompt-builder.ts`) now read "When you use workspace tools, you CALL them"; the pronoun lookup is deleted, so no code path can produce the disagreement. Blame finding recorded as a `WHY` comment at the site; the defect-pinning assertion replaced with one requiring the new sentence and forbidding `CALLS them`; both cache-determinism goldens updated after confirming the sentence was the sole delta | Owed — v5's builder is a faithful port pinned by `system_prompt_equivalence`, so it is expected to reproduce both defects and absorb the fix at the next drift round.

The gap is not survivable by resolution: the standalone tree lives in the download cache, far outside the npm package's `node_modules`, so Node's upward walk never reaches the installed copy — bridging exactly that is why `linkNativeModules` exists. `@napi-rs/canvas` also needs its binary as a **scope sibling**, so linking the wrapper alone would not have sufficed either | One shared `linkScopedPlatformSiblings` helper in `packages/quilltap/bin/quilltap.js` now serves both `sharp`→`@img/sharp-*` and `@napi-rs/canvas`→`@napi-rs/canvas-*`; it walks back as many segments as the wrapper's own name has, so scoped and unscoped wrappers both resolve correctly | Not investigated — any v5 launcher that prunes platform binaries from a shared tree owes the same relink step |

Turbopack copies externalized packages into `.next/node_modules/<pkg>-<contenthash>/` and points requires there; webpack's NFT output uses `node_modules/<pkg>`. `build-standalone-tarball.mjs` strips natives BY NAME against `<staging>/node_modules/<pkg>` and cannot see the hashed copies, so the build-once artifact stops being platform-agnostic and carries whatever the **build host** compiled — and `build-app` runs once on x86-64 ubuntu. **Every consumer broke, not just macOS:** the tarball died with *slice is not valid mach-o file*, and `Dockerfile.ci` copies that same x86-64 artifact into the **arm64** image too, where dlopen reported the misleading *cannot open shared object file* for a file that was present but x86-64 (verified: `e_machine` `3e 00` smuggled vs `b7 00` correct, on an aarch64 container). Self-inflicted by the immediately preceding commit, which converged the bundlers in the wrong direction; the strip has never covered the Turbopack layout since 7cba1eb4, but local macOS builds hid it by compiling for the platform they ran on, and CI never executes the tarball off Linux | `--webpack` pinned at all three `next build` call sites (`release.yml`, `ci.yml`, `build-standalone-tarball.mjs`), each commented as load-bearing — plus `scripts/assert-standalone-portable.mjs`, which enforces the real invariant (no native binary anywhere under `<standalone>/.next/`) in `build-app` before the artifact is uploaded and again before the tarball is written, since a convention is exactly what a plausible-looking cleanup discards. The `loadWebpackHook` failure that motivated Turbopack is already handled by `standalone-server-bootstrap.js`, which is why webpack shipped fine from 4.5 through 4.9.0-dev.51 | Not applicable to an app-logic port; applies to any v5 packaging step that prunes natives by path out of a bundler's standalone output |

Each half is survivable alone; together they cancel, because the describe-fallback is suppressed *because* the model reads images and the bytes are dropped *because* the plugin cannot send them. The model receives nothing and writes a confident paragraph about a picture it never saw. NanoGPT's own manifest said `supportsAttachments: false` and `PROVIDER_ATTACHMENT_CAPABILITIES` had no NANOGPT/Z_AI/DEEPSEEK entry at all — both sources knew, neither was in the path. The same trap poisoned describer *selection*, where an Ollama describer would invent a description from the instruction alone; the test suite had that encoded as expected behaviour | `lib/llm/image-transport.ts` (new, one predicate over the plugin registry) + `lib/chat/file-attachment-fallback.ts` (both halves must agree, at three sites) + NanoGPT plugin 1.1.0 (serialises `image_url`, keeps no vision-model list of its own — the host already decided) +1 more | **Applies.** Keep *can the model read images?* and *can the transport send them?* as two questions with one predicate each |

Asked what a picture showed, models reached for the only one that sounds like engagement and were answered *Call keep_image first to save it*: filing advice to a looking question. Quilltap actively recommended the wrong verb — the Librarian's upload announcement offered `keep_image` and `attach_image` and never said a vision model was already looking. The galling part: auto-describe had written a 3,427-char description of that exact image to the FileEntry two minutes earlier, and no tool could reach it | `lib/tools/describe-image-tool.ts` (new; serves the stored description, the generation prompt, or a vision call, and does **not** require album membership — that requirement is what made `attach_image` a dead end) + `attach_image` kept but re-scoped in description and error text + Librarian copy rewritten, with a test asserting `describe_image` is named before `attach_image` | **Applies as a design rule.** A tool vocabulary needs a verb for every intent a model actually has |

Please try resending your message.* Every clause is wrong: not a quirk but a stated refusal, and resending is guaranteed to fail, as the second attempt proved. `grep -rn sensitive lib/` returned nothing; `extractFinishReason` pulled the value correctly and its only consumers were the logger and the truncation check, while `getEmptyResponseReason` — whose entire job is explaining an empty response — inferred from three retry booleans and never took the finish reason as a parameter | `lib/llm/moderation-finish-reason.ts` (new; literal set-matching across the Z.AI / OpenAI / Azure / Google dialects — never substring, since a false positive tells a user their content was refused when it wasn't) wired into `getEmptyResponseReason`, which now names provider, model and reason and contradicts the retry advice explicitly | **Applies.** Read the provider's testimony before inferring from an empty body |

No component read it; the Salon's `SSEEvent` did not even declare the field. There is nothing to see by construction: no error, no console warning, no degraded rendering, because a model with no image writes about the image anyway. Second instance of this shape in ten bugs (bug 84 was a failing tool's `error` sibling nobody read) | `app/salon/[id]/hooks/useSSEStreaming.ts` — declare the field, warn on `done` naming the plugin's own error. A toast, not a bubble: the turn succeeded, an input to it did not | **Applies as a rule, not code.** A field plumbed end-to-end with no consumer is a latent silent failure — its cost is every bug it absorbs |

On a fresh turn the anchor is right because `newUserMessage` is pushed last; on a **regenerate or swipe** the picture landed on a 124-char connection-profile-change bubble or a Prospero memorandum — while the Librarian's announcement in the same transcript said *the bytes ride with the user's message above*. After a tool call the tail is `assistant`/`tool`, no branch matches, and the attachments are dropped with no log line | `selectAttachmentAnchorIndex` (pure, exported, unit-tested): prefer this turn's flagged user input, then the last `role: user` message whose **source row** was a genuine human turn, then the old rule as a floor so an unanticipated shape still delivers the bytes somewhere; `-1` now warns instead of failing mutely. Needed the source row id preserved through `selectRecentMessages` and the human-turn id set captured before normalization erases it | **Applies.** Any port that re-roles whispers to `user` inherits this exactly |

Two symptoms, one cause: the title never changed (next retry pushed from interchange 7 to 10, where an identical stumble burns that checkpoint too), and **no story background ever generated** — `queueStoryBackgroundIfEnabled` is called only from the rename-succeeded branch and uses the new title as its `sceneContext`, so `storyBackgroundImageId` stayed `NULL` and no `STORY_BACKGROUND_GENERATION` job was ever enqueued. Invisible by construction: job COMPLETED, LLM log well-formed, spend recorded, cursor advanced exactly as a real decline would. Intermittent — the same model titled three other chats correctly the same afternoon. Both parsers carried the same 25 duplicated lines, and the help-chat copy was mislabelled `consider-title-update`, so its LLM logs were indistinguishable from the regular path's | `lib/memory/cheap-llm-tasks/title-verdict.ts` (new; one parser for both tasks, canonical key first then a short near-miss list — `suggestTitle`, `newTitle`, `proposedTitle`, `title` — with a case/separator-folding second pass, and a warning both when it recovers from a non-canonical key and when a rename is requested with nothing readable) + the handler now warns before burning a checkpoint on an unreadable verdict | **Applies.** A structured verdict from a cheap model has two failure modes and only one is *the model said no*; reading a missing field as a decision turns a provider's stumble into a product behaviour |

Production (registry initialised) reads the stale `false`; jest (registry uninitialised) reads the static `true` — the a14a1811 suite is green over a branch production never takes. Found by the v5 port's differential, which runs the predicate in both configurations | `qtap-plugin-openrouter` 1.0.59 — `index.ts` declares `supportsAttachments: true` and **imports** its MIME list from `provider.ts`'s now-exported `SUPPORTED_IMAGE_MIME_TYPES` (one source, not two kept in step by comment), model-dependent caveat retained in the `description`/`notes` pair; new `__tests__/unit/lib/llm/image-transport.test.ts` exercises the registry-**initialised** branch and holds every bundled plugin's *built* declaration against the static mirror in `lib/llm/attachment-support.ts`; the describer guard's recommendation list (`lib/chat/file-attachment-fallback.ts`) gained the long-missing NanoGPT | **Reproduced faithfully** — v5's baked manifest carries the same `false` and its pins converge on the manifest regen at the drift round after the fix |

### Families and reading order

Bugs 1–3 are one repair: **all three must land together** or restore is still
broken. Bug 2 alone changes nothing, because Bug 3 means there is nowhere to
put the bytes.

Bug 5 is unrelated to the backup/restore family and stands alone. It is the
first entry here that did **not** come from the differential harness — the
harness could not have found it, because v5 reproduces the behaviour exactly.
It took a human running a tool in a real chat and getting the wrong answer.

Bugs 9–12 are one family (backup / restore / import integrity) and are best
fixed together, the way Bugs 1–4 were. Bug 8 was the single most urgent item in this
catalogue — it ran against live data and the loss was silent and permanent.

An [Inert dead code](#inert-dead-code) appendix lists a further set of
faithfully-ported-but-dead v4 code paths that bite no user today.

### v5 coordination

**Bugs 1–46 are fixed in v4. Bug 44 (the impersonation overlay) landed
2026-08-07; Bugs 45 and 46 landed 2026-08-07. The 1–43 close-out: the last batch, bugs 31–35,
on 2026-08-06** (bugs 8–12, 18, and 26 fixed earlier). Their
per-bug fix sites and v5 status are in the [Status](#status) table and, in full,
in each bug's own file. The coordination surface, as they were taken, is these
tripwires the v5 side must retire the day v4 converges:

| v4 fix | v5 tripwire that fires | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 8 — properties.json clobber | the `corrupt` arm of `characters_update_tier2_equivalence` | both assertions go red |
| 9 — store-delete orphans | `store_delete_equivalence` (7 arms, `reap_orphans`) | "v4 has CONVERGED — retire this divergence" |
| 10 — annotations wipe | `system_delete_data_equivalence` → `ANNOTATION_DIVERGENCE_KEY` | v5 = 0, oracle must be non-zero |
| 11 — import overwrite trio | `system_import_state` → `FOLDER_CLEAR_DIVERGENCE`, `STORE_ID_PRESERVED_ON_CREATE`, `store_identity_*` | one per defect |
| 12 — second-gen restore | `system_restore_state` dedupe arms | ruled `REPLAY_DEDUPE` |
| 15 — link-group siblings | `doc_mount_file_links_tier2_equivalence` → `CHUNK_DIVERGENCES` | fresh on v5 / stale on v4 |
| 16 — mount-chunk count | `embedding_dimension_reconcile` (`mountChunks == 0`) | mutation-tripwire |
| 20 / 21 — Almanack ledgers | `almanack_tier2_equivalence` → `reconcile_ledger_divergences` | self-retiring |
| 39 / 41 — CSS / disposition | `_utilities.css` corpus; `content_disposition` vector `ascii-apostrophe-with-non-ascii` | vanished divergence fails loud |

The **Faithful** items (13, 14, 17–19, 22–38, 40, 42, 43, and the inert list)
carry no both-directions pin — v5 reproduces them exactly, so the two sides
simply disagree once v4 is fixed. Each must be mirrored on the v5 side **in the
same round** v4 lands it, or the port falls out of step with its own oracle. Bug
8 is the exception that is also urgent: it is live data loss against real
instances, and should not wait for a convenient round.

**Bug 44 runs the OTHER way**: v5 already mirrors the shipped (wrong)
mechanism faithfully, so there is no v5 tripwire and nothing for v5 to do
first — v4 lands the overlay correction between v5 rounds and tells the
port, whose `salon_mutations` / `chat_cast_routes` / turn-chain families
then move as ordinary drift.

Bugs 1–4 had been ruled deliberate divergences on the v5 side (2026-07-24 and
2026-07-25) rather than being reproduced bug-for-bug, on the grounds that they
sit on the data-loss path. The v5 rulings are recorded in that repo's
`docs/developer/porting/status-log.md` under "Ruling — the sparse-array blob
divergence" and "Ruling — the two v4 restore bugs".

### Decisions taken while fixing

- **Bug 1 was fixed on the restore side only**, per the recommendation above.
  The backup side is untouched, so archive bytes do not change and the v5
  oracle's *backup* fixtures do not move. The coercion tolerates already-correct
  input (parse only when the value is a string, coerce only when it is a
  number), so a later backup-side normalisation can land without a second
  change here.
- **Bug 3 renumbers by insertion, not renumbering.** The moved block is
  labelled `22a-bis` and step 5 keeps a placeholder comment explaining the
  deferral — the same idiom step 19 already uses for wardrobe items deferred to
  22f-bis. Renumbering twenty-odd comments would have buried an ordering-only
  change in noise.
- **No sibling `backupFormat ===` comparisons exist**; the audit Bug 2 asks for
  turned up only the two lines it names.
- **Regression tests added**:
  `__tests__/unit/lib/backup/mount-index-coercion.test.ts`,
  `__tests__/unit/lib/backup/restore-archive-file-lookup.test.ts`,
  `__tests__/unit/lib/import/quilltap-import-stream-blobs.test.ts`. The last
  was checked against the pre-fix code: five of its seven cases fail there.

Both of Bug 5's open product calls were taken rather than left to omission:

- **Multiple user-controlled characters** — the active speaker wins, as the
  entry suggested. `activeTypingParticipantId` names a *participant* id, not a
  character id, so `operatorCharacterIds` resolves it through the participants
  array and returns an ordered candidate list (active speaker first, then the
  rest in stored order) rather than a set. A **removed** user-controlled
  participant is not a candidate at all — the operator is not playing them any
  more, whatever the roster still resolves through them.
- **A gate the operator's own character fails** — the row is kept and
  **labelled** with the character it will run as, using the `characterLabel`
  the per-variant listing already carries and the dialog already renders as
  *"as Friday"*. Omitting the row would have withheld a working tool over a gate
  that was never asked about the operator; falling through silently was the
  trap. The same label covers the other fallback case, an all-LLM room the
  operator plays nobody in. A one-character room stays unlabelled — there is
  nothing to disambiguate.
- **POST's `asCharacterId`-less fallback takes the same preference.** Strictly
  beyond the reported bug (that path rolls against `{}` by design, so no sheet
  is consulted), but it was the other place "arbitrary" meant "first", and
  leaving the two orderings different would have been a trap of its own. It
  decides only which definition of a shadowed name gets dealt.
- **Regression test added**:
  `__tests__/unit/app/api/v1/chats/custom-tools-perspective.test.ts` (10 cases).
  Checked against the pre-fix code: six of them fail there.

### Known residue from Bug 3's placement

Not a regression; a follow-up.

Immediately after 22a is the right slot, and it is worth writing down *why*,
because two nearby slots are worse:

- **After 22c** (doc-store file rows) the replay's `findOrCreateByContent`
  would match the archived content row by sha and hard-link to it, so 22f's
  `INSERT INTO doc_mount_blobs` would then violate `UNIQUE(fileId)` and the
  archived blob row would be refused.
- **After 22d** the same, plus the replay would have to unique-suffix around
  every archived link.

At 22a the doc-store has mount points and nothing else, so the replay builds an
independent set of file/link/blob rows that cannot collide with the archived
ones. What remains is narrow and warning-shaped:

- Restoring a **second-generation archive** — one taken from an instance that
  was itself restored — replays project-less files into the Quilltap Uploads
  mount at `restored/<name>`, which is exactly where the archived link rows for
  those files already live. The replay gets there first (22a-bis), so 22b's
  archived `restored` folder row and 22d's archived link rows collide with it
  and are logged as warnings. Content is present either way; the archived link
  *ids* are what get lost.
- First-generation archives are unaffected: the archived paths are `chat/`,
  `images/`, etc., and `restored/` is free.
- Project-bound files never collide at all — `projects.create` provisions a
  *fresh* official store and discards the archived `officialMountPointId`, so
  the replay and the archived rows land in different mount points. (That
  duplication predates this fix and is orthogonal to it.)

Fixing this properly means teaching the replay to recognise that the archive
already carries the store rows for a file and skip re-ingesting it, rather than
reshuffling phase order. Out of scope here.

### Owed to the v5 side

The two tripwires named above will now fire. Both are the tripwire working:
retire the divergence entries and let the cases become plain equalities.

| v4 fix | v5 tripwire | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Bugs 1–3 | `crates/quilltap-harness/tests/system_restore_state.rs` → `assert_divergences` | Re-rule the divergence as converged |
| Bug 4 | `crates/quilltap-harness/tests/system_import_equivalence.rs` → `EXPECTED_DIVERGENCES` | Remove the `throw_ndjson_truncated_blob` case |
| Bug 78 | `crates/quilltap-harness/tests/avatar_job_tier3_equivalence.rs` → `legacy_four_key_equipped` | The v4 leg asserts the throw and will now fail by design — retire the pin to a plain equality |
| Bug 79 | `crates/quilltap-harness/tests/…` → the `system_import_state` family | v4 no longer swallows; retire the both-direction pins. v5's per-step skip sentences and v4's `warnings` sentences are worded independently — converge the text only if a 1:1 sentence match is wanted (the v5 list is in that repo's `status-log.md` P4.48 entries) |

The oracle baseline moves once, at the commit that carries these fixes.

**Bug 5 fires no tripwire, which is the point.** v5 reproduces it faithfully, so
nothing over there is asserting a divergence to catch the upstream fix — the two
sides now simply disagree, silently, until the mirror lands. What v5 owes:

- `crates/quilltap-core/src/api/custom_tools.rs` — the `sightings[0]` pick at
  `:293` becomes the operator preference, and the same fallback label; the
  metadata selection at `:418-422` is unchanged.
- `src/tools/run_custom.rs:545` is **not** touched — the rolling character's own
  sheet was always right.
- Finding #30 is re-ruled from "v4-faithful, deliberately not fixed" to fixed
  upstream, and the m6 parity note for the composer popup is updated with it.

**Bug 84 fires no tripwire either**, and for the same reason: v5 reproduces it
faithfully, so nothing over there asserts a divergence. What v5 owes is two
reads:

- `apps/web/src/app/core/chat-stream.reducer.ts:379` — `applyToolResult` stores
  `result: result.result` and drops the sibling `error`; carry it through onto
  the call (or alongside it).
- `screens/salon/salon-conversation.ts:2947` — the `generate_image` failure
  branch reads `(call.result ?? {}).error`; prefer the carried `error`, keep the
  nested read as the fallback, and strip a leading `Error: ` as v4 now does.
- Finding #99 is re-ruled from "v4-faithful, deliberately not fixed" to fixed
  upstream.

## Inert dead code

These are dead or unreachable v4 code paths that cost no user anything today —
listed only so the faithful port is not "corrected" toward v4's broken original,
and so a future refactor can remove them. Each is reproduced (or omitted)
faithfully on the v5 side.

- **`roleplayTemplateName`** — set at `SalonView.tsx:140` and read nowhere; the
  only occurrences in the whole checkout are its declaration and four setters.
  Dead state.
- **The `renderedMarkdown`/`renderedHtml` fast path** — no `lib/` writer sets the
  column; the only non-schema references are the maintenance sweep that NULLs it
  and the Zod declarations. Announcements render client-side regardless.
- **`showPerMessageCost`** — unreachable for two independent reasons: the mount
  gate reads `showPerMessageTokens` only, and `MessageActionBar` passes no
  `estimatedCostUSD` (the Message type has no cost field).
- **`showSystemEvents`** — declared, parsed, and defaulted, read by no consumer.
- **`getCheapLLMProvider`'s `if (!cheapLLMSelection)` arm** — unreachable: the
  priority-5 fallback always yields the current profile, and the handler has
  already thrown if that profile is missing.
- **Provider `shouldHideChat`** — dead: zero callers, and it reads the wrong
  field name (`isDangerous` vs the real `isDangerousChat`).
- **The chat-profile `GenerateImageDialog` opener** — `useModalState.ts:63`
  exports `openGenerateImage`, which no v4 component calls; that dialog is
  unreachable (the reachable one is the standalone dialog).
- **The third recall-replay route error arm** — documented dead code.
- **`llmLoggingSettings?.retentionDays ?? 30`** — unreachable: the cell is
  Zod-parsed on read, so a NULL/absent cell arrives as the full default object and
  `retentionDays` is always present.
- **The Anthropic per-message cache arm** — dead in v4.
