# Quilltap Changelog

## Recent Changes

### 4.10-dev

#### Fixed: a hostname change no longer makes the app shut its own database down (bug 126)

The instance lock's heartbeat checked every 60 seconds whether it still owned the lock by comparing
the recorded hostname against a freshly read `os.hostname()`. On macOS that value is not stable: when
`scutil --get HostName` is unset, which is the default, the system derives the name dynamically and
reports something like `MacBook-Pro.local` at one moment and `Mac` at the next, switching on Wi-Fi
reconnects, sleep/wake, VPN changes and DHCP lease renewals. The heartbeat read the change as another
process taking the database, closed its connections and exited. Under the Electron shell the server
is not restarted, so the window stayed open over a dead backend: the home dashboard rendered nothing
while an already-open Salon tab kept drawing from its cache, which made it look like a UI problem.
Every recorded occurrence logged an identical PID with only the hostname differing.

- Lock ownership is now a snapshot taken when the lock is written — PID plus the acquisition
  timestamp — and the heartbeat compares against that. Both fields are overwritten by any process
  that takes the lock, so a real takeover is still detected immediately. Hostname is a label only.
- Acquisition no longer claims a lock just because the recorded hostname differs. A differing name
  cannot distinguish another machine from this one after a rename, so the decision is made on
  heartbeat freshness for every environment rather than only for Docker. This closes a case where
  two processes on one machine could both open the same database.
- A process whose machine was renamed now releases its own lock on exit instead of leaving a stale
  file behind, and a lock taken by manual override starts a heartbeat.
- The lock-loss shutdown now runs the same ordered teardown as SIGTERM and SIGINT, registered by
  the SQLite client. It previously used a dynamic `require` that did not resolve in the bundled
  standalone server, so it threw instead of closing anything and the WAL was left unmerged.
- `quilltap db --lock-status` no longer reports a running app as `STALE (different host)`, and
  `--lock-clean` refuses to delete a lock whose heartbeat is still being refreshed.

#### Added: character progressions

Characters can now carry progressions: named spans of time with a start, an end, and rules for how
often to report on them. A pregnancy that began on 1 August and is due 1 May; a cannon that takes
ten minutes to recharge; a fermentation that finishes in three weeks. On every prompted turn
Quilltap computes elapsed time, remaining time and percentage from the wall clock and appends a
second-person report to the character's prompt, so the model never has to do the arithmetic or
remember that time has passed.

- Stored under one reserved `progressions` key in the character vault's `metadata.json`. Every
  other key stays freeform. Validated at the point of use rather than at hydration: a malformed
  entry is dropped alone with a warning and the rest survive. Published JSON schema at
  `public/schemas/qtap-progression.schema.json`; no migration.
- Each entry declares the unit its report speaks in (`second` through `year`) and a cadence: every
  turn, whenever the whole-unit count ticks over, or at most once per wall-clock period (`1h`,
  `30s`, `2d`). An entry the user or a tool has just changed reports on the next turn regardless,
  as does one that has just started or finished.
- Spans render as whole units plus a remainder in the next finer unit ("20 weeks, 3 days"). Months
  and years are fixed-length (30.436875 and 365.2425 days), so the arithmetic is deterministic and
  calendar-free.
- Optional per-entry description, quantity (`0.3/1.0 MJ`), and report template with placeholders
  (`{{elapsed}}`, `{{remaining}}`, `{{percent}}`, `{{quantity}}`, and others). An unknown
  placeholder renders as written.
- The report is a trailing per-turn section, after Suparṇā's mail and before the turn-skip note.
  It never enters the cached system block, so prompt caching is unaffected and no builder version
  is bumped. It is not persisted as a message. The greeting builder and Carina both append a forced
  report; continue turns skip it.
- Cadence is derived from the character's own last turn in the chat rather than stored, so the
  prompt path performs no writes. A character who is prompted but does not speak can hear a
  period-cadence entry once more inside the same period; this is documented.
- Pascal custom tools gain a `progress` read subject (`when.progress`, availability gates) keyed
  `"<id>.<field>"`, `{{progress.<id>.<field>}}` and `{{now}}` placeholders, and
  `progress.<id>.<field>` effect targets. A tool can be withheld until a recharge completes and
  re-arm it on a successful roll with `{{now}}` and `{{now}} + 600000`. Writing to an unknown id
  creates the progression; `remove` deletes one. Progress writes fold into the existing single
  character metadata write. A result the schema refuses is rolled back and the roll still stands.
- `metadata.progressions` and `metadata.progressions.*` are refused as effect
  targets when a tool file loads. An effect writes a primitive, so the former
  would replace the whole reserved object with a string, bypassing the
  progressions validation and rollback; the latter would write a literal key
  named `progressions.cannon` and touch no progression.
- The model cannot set its own progression: there is no LLM tool for it, and the `state` tool has
  no access. Only the user and Pascal's server-side effects write them.
- New Progressions card on the Aurora character edit page (System Prompts tab) with an editor for
  each entry and a live preview of the line the character will read. Archived characters are
  read-only.
- Pascal's Workbench gains the `progress` condition subject, the `progress.` effect-target prefix,
  the `{{now}}` and `{{progress.…}}` insert options, and a live list of what a hand-typed fact
  sheet's progressions derive to.

#### Docs: plan for character progressions

Added `docs/developer/features/character-progressions.md`: a plan for timed, in-progress
character properties (a pregnancy with a due date, a weapon recharging over ten minutes). Each one
is stored under a reserved `progressions` key in the vault's `metadata.json` with a published JSON
schema, and on every prompted turn the character is told elapsed time, remaining time and percent
complete, deterministically, in the unit and at the cadence the entry declares. The report lives in
the uncached per-turn tail of the prompt, never in the cached system block. Pascal custom tools gain
a `progress.<id>.<field>` read subject and gate, a `{{now}}` reference, and `progress.*` effect
targets so a roll can re-arm a countdown. Includes an Aurora editor card and a phased task list.
No code changes yet.

#### Added: character subprompts

Characters can now carry subprompts: short, optional instructions stored as Markdown files in
the vault's root-level `Subprompts/` folder (frontmatter `title`, body = the instruction, written
in the second person like a system prompt). The folder is created on the first write; a missing
folder lists as empty.

- Which subprompts are in play is stored per seat on the chat (`participants[].selectedSubpromptIds`).
  Pick them from a Subprompts dropdown under each character's system-prompt selector in the New Chat
  dialog, and from the same dropdown on the participant card in the Salon's Participants drawer.
  Every dropdown offers "New subprompt…", which opens the Lexical editor in place and ticks the new
  one on.
- Manage them on the Aurora System Prompts tab, beneath the primary prompts. The AI Wizard and
  Character Optimizer leave subprompts alone.
- Selected subprompts render in the compiled identity stack directly after the system prompt as an
  `## Additional Instructions` block, and in the greeting. Changing the selection recompiles the
  seat's cached stack; editing a subprompt recompiles every chat carrying it; deleting one strips it
  from those seats first. A seat with none selected produces a byte-identical prompt, so no builder
  version bump.
- A character dressing themselves in the green room sees the selected subprompts alongside their
  dressing instructions.
- New routes: `GET/POST /api/v1/characters/[id]/subprompts`,
  `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/characters/[id]/subprompts/[subpromptId]`.

### 4.9.2

#### Fixed: a help chat's tool results now reach the model on every provider (bug 124)

Asking the Help dialog something the character had to look up ("Where do I change the theme? Take me
there.") produced nothing on OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Grok, Ollama, DeepSeek, NanoGPT and Z.AI
seats. The help chat's own agent loop sent tool results back as `tool` messages with no call id and
an assistant turn with no tool calls attached. Every provider plugin except Google drops a tool row
it cannot pair, so the model never saw its search results, searched again, and the repeated-call
guard ended the turn with an empty reply. Google seats answered because that plugin keeps an
unpaired row.

- The help loop now builds its assistant turn and tool rows through the same threading helpers the
  Salon and the Brahma Console use. A result with a provider call id is paired to its call; one
  without (the text-block tool path) is framed as `[Tool Result: <name>]` user text.
- The stuck-loop reminder now uses the last result directly instead of searching the message list
  by role.
- Two regression tests drive one native tool turn through the help loop and check the messages
  the follow-up request receives.

#### Fixed: Google no longer rejects a tool-enabled turn whose tool slate includes the wardrobe tools (bug 125)

A Gemini profile with tool use on, in a help chat or in any chat whose character has a wardrobe,
failed every turn with `Invalid JSON payload received. Unknown name "additionalProperties" at
'...parameters.properties[0].value.items'`. The Google plugin strips JSON Schema fields Google's
function-calling API does not accept, but `additionalProperties` was not on the list. The top-level
one never reached the wire, while the one under the wardrobe tools' `operations` array items did.

- `additionalProperties` is now stripped at every depth. Google plugin 1.1.51.
- A regression test runs the real `wardrobe_wear` and `wardrobe_take_off` schemas through the
  sanitizer. Loading the plugin under Jest needed a manual mock for the ESM-only `@google/genai` SDK.

### 4.9.1

#### Fixed: a paused chat no longer goes quiet without saying so, and Skip is always offered (bug 123)

When a chained character turn failed (a provider error that exhausted the fallback chain), the server
paused the chat as a safety stop. The Salon learned of the first pause and showed Resume, but not of a
second one a few minutes later: the client only re-read the pause flag when the fetched value changed,
and pressing Resume had changed the local flag without updating the fetched copy. The fetched value went
from paused to paused, nothing fired, and the client believed the chat was live while the server held it
paused. Every message then drew exactly one reply, nudges worked but chained nowhere, and the sidebar
read "Pause" throughout. A reload was the only fix.

- The client now reconciles its pause flag with the server's on every fetch, and Pause/Resume update
  the fetched chat object too.
- A turn chain that stops because the chat is paused now emits a `paused` chain-complete event and
  logs, instead of returning silently. Every chain-complete carries a `paused` flag; the chain-error
  safety stop sets it, an empty-response stop does not.
- The Salon shows a toast when a chain stops on a pause the user did not cause, with specific wording
  when a character's turn failed. All-LLM rooms keep their existing pause dialog instead.
- The Skip button is offered whenever the composer will accept a message as a character you control,
  your own or one you are impersonating, not only when the rotation has formally landed on that seat.
  The banner wording says whose turn it is. Skipping an impersonated seat now works from the client
  (the server already allowed it), and skipping lifts a pause first, as nudging does. The must-speak
  guard is unchanged.
