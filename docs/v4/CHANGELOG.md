# Quilltap Changelog

## Recent Changes

### 4.9-dev

#### NanoGPT: suppress the gateway's reasoning echo (plugin 1.0.2, bug 87)

On some routed paths NanoGPT re-emits the entire answer down the reasoning channel after the content stream ends, so a turn rendered its whole reply a second time inside a thinking fold anchored at the end of the message. Intermittent and gateway-side: identical requests minutes apart streamed clean, and token accounting shows the echo was never billed as model output. The plugin now holds post-prose reasoning while it remains a verbatim prefix of the streamed prose — if it diverges it's real thinking and commits in full; if it still mirrors the prose at stream end it's the echo and is dropped (from live chunks, the final chunk, and the raw response). Non-streaming responses drop `message.reasoning` when it equals the content exactly. Genuine pre-content reasoning is untouched. Tests added to `nanogpt-reasoning.test.ts`.

#### NanoGPT gains thinking options (plugin 1.0.1)

- New connection-profile options schema with **Reasoning Effort** (none / minimal / low / medium / high / xhigh), forwarded as NanoGPT's `reasoning_effort` parameter. Any value other than `none` requests reasoning; blank defers to the model.
- `thinkingTurnRule` declared on the plugin so multi-character turns on a thinking profile anchor in prose instead of the `[Name]` prefill (bug 85's rule), with `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5:thinking` catalogued as thinks-by-default; uncatalogued `:thinking` picks rely on the explicit effort setting.
- Fixed reasoning display: NanoGPT's main endpoint carries reasoning in `delta.reasoning` / `message.reasoning`, not the legacy `reasoning_content` the plugin was reading (which is now the fallback). Without this the thinking fold stayed empty for most routed reasoning models.
- Tests: `nanogpt-reasoning.test.ts` (rule/schema partition, catalogue habits, both wire dialects); NanoGPT joins the options-schema snapshot test.

#### NanoGPT is a bundled provider (chat, images, embeddings)

New bundled plugin `qtap-plugin-nanogpt` (1.0.0) adds NanoGPT (nano-gpt.com), a pay-as-you-go gateway fronting 600+ chat models, 200+ image models, and two dozen embedding models behind one OpenAI-compatible API and a single new `NANOGPT` API key type.

- **Chat:** OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions at `nano-gpt.com/api/v1` with streaming, tool calling, JSON response formats, and reasoning display — routed thinking models' `reasoning_content` streams into the Salon's thinking fold. Model list merges the live `/models` endpoint with a small curated static catalog (NanoGPT's `auto-model*` routers plus current flagships).
- **Images:** the OpenAI-compatible images route with `b64_json` pinned (plus a URL-download fallback), following the honest Fetch Models contract: without a key you get the curated list; with a key the dedicated `/image-models` listing is queried and filtered to models whose capability flags say they generate images (edit-only and upscale-only entries excluded), and transport failures throw so the route can label the fallback. Provider-level orientation constraints (832x1248 / 1248x832 / 1024x1024), a parameters panel with common sizes, and provider badge/icon/fallback entries in the image-profile UI.
- **Embeddings:** OpenAI-compatible `/embeddings` with live model discovery via `/embedding-models`. `NANOGPT` joins the embedding profile provider enum (schema, export JSON schema, UI types/metadata/badges, first-startup seed type). New `.qt-badge-provider-nanogpt` badge class; the whole `qt-badge-provider-*` family was mirrored into theme-storybook (1.0.61), which previously lacked it.
- Tests: NanoGPT joins the image-orientation contract's provider-level list; new `nanogpt-image-provider-models.test.ts` covers the model-listing contract, b64 passthrough, and URL-download fallback.

#### Image profiles can fetch models from the provider, honestly

The image-profile editor gains a "Fetch Models" button (parity with connection profiles). Before, four of the five image-capable plugins "implemented" model listing by returning their hardcoded list even when handed an API key — only OpenRouter actually asked its API — and the form auto-fetched silently with no indication of where the list came from.

- Each image provider now genuinely queries its provider when given an API key, filtered to models that actually produce images: OpenAI filters `/v1/models` to the `dall-e-*`/`gpt-image-*` Images-API families; Google pages the Gemini models list and keeps imagen models exposing `predict` plus gemini models with image output (video/text/embedding models excluded); Grok uses xAI's dedicated `GET /v1/image-generation-models` endpoint; Z.AI filters its `/models` list by the image-model pattern (unioned with the documented CogView/GLM-Image set, since that endpoint under-reports). Without a key, the plugin's curated list is returned unchanged.
- On live-fetch failure the providers now throw instead of silently substituting the static list, so `?action=list-models` can label its response `source: 'provider'` or `'builtin'` (with the fetch error attached). The form shows which one you're looking at. Only genuinely live-fetched lists are cached in `provider_models`.
- Google's Gemini-vs-Imagen routing now treats any `gemini*` model as a generateContent model, so live-fetched IDs (e.g. preview image models) don't fall through to the Imagen predict endpoint.
- Providers that cannot produce images (Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible) are unchanged and stay out of the image-provider list.

#### Z.AI is a first-class image provider

The Z.AI plugin already shipped an image provider (CogView-4, GLM-Image), but the UI never wired it up and generation was broken end-to-end: Z.AI returns image URLs, while every Quilltap consumer reads only base64, so a generated image evaporated. The provider now downloads the URL and returns base64. The image-profile UI gains a Z.AI provider badge/icon, a parameters panel with Z.AI's recommended sizes, and a fallback provider entry. Help doc updated to list the providers Quilltap actually supports (and to stop claiming Midjourney/Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI support it never had).

Plugin versions: openai 1.0.59, google 1.1.47, grok 1.0.51, z-ai 1.1.23, openrouter 1.0.58.

#### The DeepSeek plugin can tell when it is thinking (bug 86)

`isThinkingEnabled(body)` decided whether an outgoing request was a thinking request by looking for `thinking: { type: 'enabled' }` in the body it was about to send. That answers "what did we ask for?" when the question is "what will the model do?" — the V4 models reason with `parameters: {}`, which is the default state, so a profile that had never touched the thinking option was judged not to be thinking. `stripThinkingIncompatibleParams` never ran, and `temperature`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, and `presence_penalty` were sent into a request that ignores them. DeepSeek discards them silently, so nothing errored.

`willRunThinkingTurn(body)` replaces it and asks the two questions in the order the host's `evaluateThinkingTurn` asks them: the profile's explicit `thinking: enabled` / `disabled` first, then the model's own habit from `STATIC_MODELS.thinksByDefault`. No signature change was needed — both call sites already pass a body carrying `model`. The model lookup is an exact id match, matching the host, so a model DeepSeek serves that the static catalogue does not list contributes no habit and behaves as before.

The plugin README claimed thinking mode was a `deepseek-v4-pro` feature reached through profile parameters, which is the belief that produced the predicate. It now says both V4 models reason by default and that `thinking` exists mainly to turn reasoning off, with a "Thinks by default" column in the model table. The connection-profile editor's own help text carried the same misapprehension and was corrected with it: "(model default)" means thinking is ON.

Also added the migration test that should have shipped with bug 85: `retire-prefill-on-thinking-profiles-v1` now has coverage for what it clears (thinking-active DeepSeek and Ollama rows) and, more importantly, what it leaves alone — thinking-off profiles, uncatalogued models, other providers, rows already at 0, stored nulls, and unparseable `parameters`.

#### DeepSeek thinking models stop 400ing on every character turn (bug 85)

A chat on a DeepSeek profile using `deepseek-v4-flash` greeted you and then died on every turn after, with HTTP 400: "The `reasoning_content` in the thinking mode must be passed back to the API". The error text points at history; the cause is the trailing `[Name]` prefill.

In a multi-character chat each reply is anchored to one character, either by appending an assistant message containing `[Character Name]` or by appending a prose instruction to the system prompt. `isMultiCharacterChat` counts one LLM seat as multi-character, so a plain one-character chat takes the anchor too. DeepSeek's thinking mode reads a request ending on an assistant message as a turn to continue and demands the `reasoning_content` that produced it — which a synthetic prefill has none of. The greeting escapes because `lib/chat/initial-greeting.ts` applies no anchor at all.

The predicate deciding which anchor to use was provider-shaped (`PREFILL_HOSTILE_PROVIDERS`, holding `ANTHROPIC`) when the property is model-shaped. Two of the three known hostilities are thinking failures, not provider quirks: Ollama's chat template never opens the reasoning block behind a prefilled turn (bug 68), and DeepSeek 400s (this bug). Only Anthropic's is genuinely structural, so that one stays a provider rule.

The prefill default now also asks whether the profile will run a thinking turn:

- `ModelInfo` gained `supportsThinking` and `thinksByDefault`. The two are separate because providers differ — `deepseek-v4-flash` reasons with `parameters: {}`, while Anthropic and Ollama thinking is opt-in per profile.
- `TextProviderPlugin` gained `thinkingTurnRule`, naming the `parameters` key that switches reasoning on or off and which values mean which. It is declarative rather than a predicate function because the connection-profile editor needs the same answer in the browser, where a server-side plugin closure can't be called; it serialises out through `/api/v1/providers`. DeepSeek and Ollama declare one; no other provider's behaviour changes.
- `lib/llm/thinking-turn.ts` holds the one pure evaluator both sides run — an explicit profile choice wins, else the model's `thinksByDefault`, else no. `providerRegistry.profileRunsThinkingTurn()` joins it to the plugin table server-side.
- `defaultMultiCharacterPrefill(provider, runsThinkingTurn)` returns false for a thinking profile. `profileUsesNamePrefill` is unchanged in spirit: a stored boolean still outranks every default, so ticking the box back on is honoured.
- The profile editor re-seeds the checkbox when the model changes, corrects a stored-null row once the model list loads, and warns when the box is ticked on a thinking profile.
- Migration `retire-prefill-on-thinking-profiles-v1` clears the stored `1` on existing DeepSeek and Ollama profiles that are running a thinking turn. Those rows got their `1` from the old provider default at creation, not from a user choice, and it outranks any default fix. Rows already at `0`, and profiles not running a thinking turn, are untouched. The migration carries a frozen copy of the two plugins' rules, because migrations run before the plugin registry is up.

A non-thinking DeepSeek or Ollama profile keeps the prefill, which is the stronger anchor and what weak models need most — that was bug 68's stated objection to a blanket provider rule, and it is preserved rather than re-incurred.

Two adjacent DeepSeek plugin defects found while investigating were filed separately as [bug 86](developer/bugs/fixed/bug-86-deepseek-thinking-detection.md) and are fixed below. Neither caused the 400.

#### A failed image generation says what actually went wrong (bug 84)

When `generate_image` failed, the notice above the composer read `Failed to generate image` and the toast read `Image generation failed: Unknown error` — every time, no matter the cause. Asking for an image in a chat with no image profile resolved is the common case, and the remedy is right there in the server's own sentence: `Image generation is not enabled for this chat`.

The server had been sending that sentence all along. The SSE tool-result frame carries it in `error`, a sibling of `result`, specifically because `result` is null on failure. The Salon looked for it one level down at `result.error`, found nothing, and fell back to its generic strings — so the field had no reader anywhere in the app.

The failure text is now resolved through one helper, `resolveToolResultErrorText`, which prefers the sibling `error`, keeps the old nested read as a fallback, and strips the executor's leading `Error: ` so the toast doesn't read "failed: Error: ...". Both the notice and the toast render the same resolved sentence.

#### The intermittent jest worker segfault was V8's, not SQLCipher's (bug 83)

For months, roughly one full `npm run test:unit` run in five ended with `A jest worker process ... was terminated by another process: signal=SIGSEGV` failing one arbitrary suite while every actual test passed, and a rerun always went green. It was assumed to be the known native-SQLCipher teardown flake fixed in June. A macOS crash report proved otherwise: the dying worker had no `better_sqlite3.node` loaded at all, and the faulting stack matched [nodejs/node#62393](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/62393) frame-for-frame — a V8 13.6 (Node 24) GC race where a mark-compact triggered inside Sparkplug's baseline prologue dereferences a junk frame slot. Upstream still reproduces it on Node 26, so the fix is the thread's proven workaround: disable the Sparkplug baseline compiler for test runs. The five jest scripts in `package.json` now launch `node --no-sparkplug node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js` (the flag isn't allowed in `NODE_OPTIONS`), and `jest.global-setup.js` appends `--no-sparkplug` to `process.execArgv` before any worker forks, so ad-hoc `npx jest` runs get protected workers too — jest-worker inherits the parent's `execArgv`. The integration config now shares that globalSetup, which also gives it the native-ABI self-heal. Nine consecutive full runs (half with a cleared transform cache) produced zero crashes; upstream's matrices report the same at larger sample sizes with no measurable wall-time cost. Also tightened while in there: `quantize-embeddings.test.ts` now closes its per-test in-memory database like every other real-binding suite. Filed as [bug 83](developer/bugs/fixed/bug-83-v8-sparkplug-worker-segfault.md).

#### Group scenes stop turning into committee meetings

In a multi-character chat, especially on weaker models, every character's turn converged on the same shape: open with a roll-call recap of what the previous speakers said, endorse all of it, claim "the one thing nobody has named yet," repeat the cast's coined phrases verbatim, and close by restating the group's action list. One observed chat had three characters in a row ending consecutive turns with the identical sentence. Three changes attack the loop:

- **Group-scene discipline rules** now ride in the system prompt on every multi-character turn (both the `[Name]`-prefill and prose anchor routes). They forbid opening with a recap of other speakers, agree-then-add replies, reusing another character's metaphors or coined phrases, and restating the plan; they tell the character to speak only when it changes something, and to vary length instead of defaulting to a speech. The previous anchor only pinned *who* was speaking and said nothing about content, so the strongest style signal in context was the preceding chorus itself.
- **The turn-skip note counts an echo as nothing to say.** The "you may pass" note now states that a reply which mostly restates, endorses, or rephrases what has already been said — even in the character's own voice — is not substantive, and the character should pass.
- **"Recently addressed" now means directly addressed.** `isRecentlyAddressed` used to fire on any name mention since the character last spoke. Because every chorus turn named most of the cast in its recap, every character was permanently "addressed," so every turn note carried the "answer rather than pass" caution and nobody ever passed — the recap ritual and the skip mechanism fed each other. The check now requires a vocative position (name at a clause boundary followed by address punctuation: "Marion, …", "Greg?", "Amy —"), an `@`-mention, or a targeted whisper; possessives and mid-sentence citations ("Marion's point", "if Greg is ready") no longer count.

#### The Commonplace Book can consult past conversations on every turn

A character's vault holds a summary of every conversation it has taken part in, and the Commonplace Book searches that shelf to build the "Relevant Past Conversations" list a character sees. Until now that list was refreshed on three cadences only: the opening recap (chat start or character join), each summary fold, and retrospective turns that reference the past explicitly. Between folds the list stood still, so the conversation could wander several turns away from the past dialogues the character was still being pointed at.

A new instance-wide setting — Settings → Memory → Recall Relevance → **Consult past conversations every turn** — re-runs that search on every turn and folds the fresh list into the consolidated whisper. It is off by default.

The reason it can run per turn at all is that it costs no extra embedding call. `searchMemoriesSemantic` now reports the vector it embedded for the turn's memory search through a `captureQueryEmbedding` hook, and `searchVaultConversationSummaries` accepts that vector via `precomputedEmbedding` instead of embedding the same sentence again. The proactive pre-search path threads its vector through `runPreContextPreCompute` → `buildMessageContext` → `buildContext`, so the reuse holds on both memory paths. When no vector is available (memories skipped, no embedding profile, a failed embedding, or the degraded text-search fallback), the cadence sits the turn out rather than paying for a call of its own.

The per-turn search is skipped on the turn the opening recap runs — the recap already carries its own freshly-searched list, and a second one would repeat it inside a single whisper. Otherwise the per-turn list is deduplicated against the standing fold-posted `relevant-conversations` whisper, and the retrospective mini-recap is now deduplicated against both — one conversation UUID is never listed twice to the same character in the same turn. List length ramps with the connection profile's context window (3 entries at 4K, 10 at 32K), the same ramp the fold cadence uses; the constants now live in `lib/memory/conversation-summary-search.ts` so the two cadences cannot drift apart.

There is no chat-, project-, or character-level override: the setting is on for every conversation or off for every conversation.

#### Local models with strict chat templates stop failing on every turn after the first (bug 82)

A chat on a local Ollama or OpenAI-compatible server running a Qwen model would greet you and then never answer again. Every turn after the opening died with `Jinja Exception: System message must be at the beginning`, and because the failure was an HTTP 500 from the endpoint rather than an empty reply, it showed up as a toast and a server-log entry and nothing else.

The context builder emits the head of a turn as up to three consecutive system messages on purpose: the persona prefix, the identity reinforcement, and the compressed-history summary, kept separate so a cache breakpoint on the first isn't invalidated by churn in the others. Hosted providers accept that. A local runtime doesn't answer for itself — it applies the model's own chat template, and the Qwen family (plus several Llama- and Gemma-derived templates) raises an exception on any system message after index 0, rejecting the whole request before a token is generated. The greeting sends one system message, which is why it worked.

The leading run is now folded into a single message at request-build time, in the Ollama and OpenAI-compatible builders only, joined with blank lines so nothing is lost from the prompt. `@quilltap/plugin-utils` gained `collapseLeadingSystemMessages`, and `OpenAICompatibleProvider` gained an `acceptsRepeatedSystemMessages` flag that defaults to true — so hosted providers, including DeepSeek and every other subclass, send exactly the bytes they sent before, and their cache breakpoints land where they always did.

#### An OpenAI-Compatible profile can hold an API key (bug 81)

Pointing an OpenAI-Compatible profile at a hosted service — Together, Fireworks, Groq, DeepInfra, a vLLM behind auth, a corporate gateway — was impossible: the profile form showed no API Key field for that provider, and Settings → API Keys → Add New API Key didn't offer OpenAI-Compatible at all, so no such key could be created. The request went out unauthenticated and the endpoint returned 401.

One flag, `requiresApiKey`, was answering two different questions: must this provider have a key, and may it have one? For every other provider those answers match. OpenAI-Compatible is the one that spans both worlds — an unauthenticated llama.cpp on localhost and a hosted endpoint behind a bearer token — so `false` was the only workable value, and `false` removed the provider from both key surfaces.

Providers can now declare `acceptsApiKey` alongside `requiresApiKey`. Omitted, it means the same answer as `requiresApiKey`, so no existing plugin changes behavior; Ollama still offers no key field. OpenAI-Compatible declares `false`/`true`: the key field appears, unstarred and optional, and an OpenAI-Compatible key can be created in Settings → API Keys.

The server side needed the same split. The chat, Brahma Console and help-chat paths all gated the key lookup on `requiresApiKey`, so even a key attached to an OpenAI-Compatible profile was dropped before the request left. They now go through one resolver that requires a key where a key is required and forwards one wherever a key is accepted; a profile naming a key that has since been deleted fails loudly instead of silently going out bare.

#### Story background prompts stop concealing nudity when the image provider doesn't require it

The story-background prompt crafter carries a "depicting intimate or unclothed states" section that teaches it to translate narrative nudity into cinematic concealment — a sheet draped where it's needed, a silhouette, foreground occlusion, a bath at a discreet level. That exists to get a prompt past image-provider moderation, and it was unconditional: baked into the system prompt constant, applied to every story background regardless of where the image was going.

So a chat marked dangerous with a Concierge uncensored image profile configured got accurate per-character appearance text ("nude" — appearance sanitization already steps aside for exactly this case) fed into a crafter that then draped a sheet over it. The concealment was being applied to clear moderation the target provider does not perform.

The intimacy guidance is now selected per call. `StoryBackgroundPromptContext` gains `uncensoredImageTarget`, and the crafter's system prompt is assembled from a shared head/tail plus one of two intimacy blocks: cinematic concealment (the default, unchanged wording) or candid depiction. The candid variant keeps every background-framing rule — figures toward the edges, environment primary, wide atmospheric shot, never an anatomical close-up — and both variants still refuse to re-dress a character the narrative undressed.

The handler passes `isDangerousChat && hasUncensoredImageProvider`, the same signal `sanitizeAppearancesIfNeeded` already uses, so the two layers now agree. The empty-response retry that swaps in the uncensored text profile carries the flag through, instead of re-sending the concealment instructions to an uncensored model.

Third case: when a standard provider accepts the prompt and then rejects the finished image on moderation grounds, the Concierge reroutes to the uncensored image profile — and that path was resending the already-concealed prompt verbatim. It now re-crafts the prompt candidly for the reroute target first. Best-effort: a failed re-craft keeps the existing prompt so the reroute still produces an image.

Unchanged: the `generate_image` tool's prompt crafter, which never had concealment language; the avatar prompt builder, whose bare-chest handling is a framing constraint (crop at the collarbone) rather than prompt prose; and concealment as the default everywhere a moderated provider is the target.

#### A project's story background follows its display-mode setting again (bug 80)

A project set to "Latest chat background" (or "Project background", or a static upload) showed the theme's Prospero image instead. The setting saved correctly and the API returned the right image — only the page never painted it.

The tabbed workspace replaced each view's own background layer with a single arbitrated backdrop, so two panes in a split can't paint over each other. Views report their background to it, and the old per-view layer is suppressed inside the workspace. The project detail view was never converted: it still set the CSS variable for a layer that is now hidden, and reported nothing. What painted instead was the projects list's subsystem background, which stayed registered under the tab even after you drilled into a project.

The project detail now reports its background to the backdrop, falling back to the Prospero image when the project's mode is "Theme colors". The list's subsystem background moved into its own component that unmounts while a project is open, so exactly one background is registered per tab — which also fixes the deep-link case (opening a project straight into a new tab), where the two competing reporters used to resolve the wrong way.

#### Avatar generation no longer crashes on chats older than the hair slot (bug 78)

`equippedOutfit` is unconstrained JSON, and the hair slot was added without a migration: every slot key defaults to an empty array, so a chat row written before the slot existed is supposed to read back with `hair: []`. That held everywhere the value passed through the schema, and `getEquippedOutfit` was the one place it did not — it returned the stored object through a raw cast. The outfit resolver then indexed the missing key and handed `undefined` to `expandComposites`, which threw `rootIds is not iterable` and killed the avatar job.

This hit any chat created before the hair slot that has something equipped — in practice every long-lived instance, since only chats made after the feature write all five keys. Two more readers behind the same call degrade quietly instead of crashing: the scene-state tracker and the context manager's live-outfit override both sit behind their own try/catch, so the model simply stopped being told what the character was wearing.

Stored slot bags are now normalized in one place (`normalizeEquippedSlots` in `lib/schemas/wardrobe.types.ts`) on the way out of the column, which fixes the crash and the two silent readers together. A bag the schema refuses outright — a bad id in one slot — is salvaged key by key rather than discarded, so a repair never costs you clothing that was still legible. The resolver keeps an `?? []` of its own for callers that pass a slot bag directly, and the wardrobe-create tool now reads the post-equip state through the repository instead of off the chat row by hand.

#### Import says so when it can't read the destination (bug 79)

Repository reads answer a failure with a fallback value — `null`, `[]`, `false` — which is the right default when the alternative is a blank screen. The importers were consuming those values as facts about the destination ("no such row", "no collision") and committing writes on the strength of them. On a database that fails individual reads — a corrupt page, a missing table after a bad migration, a competing writer — an entity that *existed* read as *absent*, the import took the wrong branch and produced duplicates or skipped merges, and it reported success with nothing in its warnings.

Import and import preview now run with those fallbacks suspended: a read that fails stays a failure, lands in the importer's per-item handler, and is reported by name. Partial progress still works the way it did — one unreadable entity is skipped rather than aborting the run — but the summary now names what was skipped and why.

Five importers (tags, roleplay templates, and the three profile types) were only writing failures to the log, never to the warnings you see. They now report them like the others. So does the preserve-ids preflight, which refuses the whole import before anything is written and had been returning failure with no explanation at all — including when a character rehydrate uses it, which previously reported "unknown import error".

#### Workspace tabs refresh their data when you navigate back to them

The workspace keeps every open tab mounted (that's what lets a streaming Salon survive tab switches), which meant a tab you returned to still showed whatever it had loaded when you left — rename a character in their detail tab and the characters list behind it kept the old name until a full page reload.

Now a tab refreshes its data sources every time it becomes the active tab again. The Home tab reloads its dashboard (recent chats, active projects, characters); the characters, chats, projects, Scriptorium, Files, Photos, Scenarios, Pascal's Workbench, Wardrobe, Profile, Generate Image, and Settings tabs all refetch what they display, including in-place detail views (a project or document store you've drilled into). Refreshes are silent — the current content stays on screen while fresh data loads, so nothing flickers back to a loading screen.

Mechanics: each tab's subtree now knows its own visibility (`useOnTabActivated` in `components/workspace/workspace-tab-context.tsx`). TanStack Query reads are invalidated centrally from a per-tab-kind map (`lib/workspace/tab-refetch.ts`); views still fetching outside TanStack Query re-run their loads through the same hook with a new `silent` option so loading flags don't flip. Live surfaces (Salon conversations, terminals, Document Mode) and editors with unsaved state (character edit, the settings wizard, standalone documents) are deliberately left alone.

#### An API key no longer follows a connection profile onto another provider (bug 76)

Changing a connection profile's provider left the previously selected API key in form state, and the form sent it regardless. On a keyless provider (Ollama, OpenAI-Compatible) the API Key select isn't rendered at all, so saving failed with `API key provider does not match profile provider` — a message about a field that isn't on screen, with no way to clear it. On a different hosted provider the select re-rendered blank, because its options are filtered to the current provider, while Connect / Fetch Models / Test Message kept sending the old provider's key.

The form now sends only a key the select could currently display: nothing when the provider requires no key, and nothing when the stored id isn't among the options listed for the current provider. This is the same `outboundBaseUrl` chokepoint bug 73 added, one field over (`outboundApiKeyId` in `useProfileForm`). Connect's own validation judges the same value, so a blank select reports "API Key is required for this provider" instead of probing with a hidden key. The save body always sends the field, `null` when nothing may leave, so a profile already saved with a mismatched key clears it on the next save instead of being refused forever.

Two lists are treated as "not loaded" rather than as evidence: an unknown provider keeps its stored key, and an API-key list that hasn't arrived yet skips the displayability check entirely. The provider dropdown still doesn't clear the field, so switching back to the original provider restores the selection.

#### New "hair" wardrobe slot

The wardrobe gains a fifth slot, `hair`, alongside top/bottom/footwear/accessories. It holds a *hairdo*, not hair: braids, an updo, marcel waves, a severe bun, the occasional wig. A character's natural hair — colour, length, texture — stays in the physical description, where it has always lived. The distinction is stated the same way in every prompt that draws the wardrobe/physical line.

Hair is threaded through every surface that knows about slots: the wardrobe tools (`wardrobe_create`, `wardrobe_update`, `wardrobe_wear`, `wardrobe_take_off`, `wardrobe_list`), the outfit-choosing LLM at chat start, all three AI character generators, the Character Optimizer, wardrobe-from-image analysis, avatar and Lantern scene prompts, the wardrobe dialogs and the Green Room preview (rose badge), and `.qtap` exports.

Hair is deliberately not clothing:

- **An empty hair slot is never reported.** Slots now carry a `reportWhenEmpty` property. Garment slots announce their vacancies ("topless", "barefoot") because a missing shoe is information; hair does not, because an empty hair slot means unstyled hair, not a bald character. Nothing — Aurora's announcements, scene state, image prompts, or wardrobe tool results — says anything about hair when the slot is blank.
- **Nudity semantics ignore hair.** "Completely naked and unadorned", the "naked" collapse, and the deliberately-unclothed detector are all computed over clothing slots only. A naked character keeps their braids, and an outfit of nothing but a hairdo still counts as "chose nothing to wear".
- **Avatars carry the hairdo** on both the dressed and bare-top branches.
- **Undressing keeps the hairstyle** in the scene-state clothing summary unless the narrative explicitly takes it down.

Hats remain accessories — a hat is worn over a coiffure.

Two upgrade notes. Every chat's cached clothing summary is re-derived once after upgrade (the equipped-outfit hash now includes the hair key), a one-time cheap-LLM call per active chat. And a `.qtap` export containing hair items imports into *older* Quilltap builds with those items silently skipped; everything else comes through.

No migration and no schema change: `equippedOutfit` is unconstrained JSON and every slot defaults to an empty array, so existing rows parse with `hair: []`.

Internally, the duplicated slot lists are gone. `lib/schemas/wardrobe.types.ts` now holds one ordered slot list plus a metadata registry (`WARDROBE_SLOT_META`) carrying each slot's labels, badge class, clothing flag, and empty-reporting rule; the four UI label/badge maps, three local `SLOT_KEYS` copies, two `cloneSlots` copies, and five independent `validTypes` sets all read from it.

#### Docs: removed the outfit-preset endpoints and fixed the equipped-outfit shape

`docs/developer/API.md` documented six `/api/v1/characters/[id]/wardrobe/presets*` endpoints (list, create, read, update, delete, `?action=apply`) that no longer exist — outfit presets were retired when composite wardrobe items replaced them, and there is no `presets` route under `app/api/v1/characters/[id]/wardrobe/`. The section is now marked as removed and carries a mapping table from each old preset call to its current equivalent (the ordinary wardrobe routes, plus `POST /api/v1/chats/[id]?action=equip` for applying one), along with a pointer to the legacy-preset folding that import and backup restore still perform.

The same region showed the pre-4.5 equipped shape — one UUID per slot, `null` when empty. Every slot has been an array of ids since 4.5 (slots layer; composites are stored as their own id and expanded at read time). The `GET /api/v1/chats/[id]?action=outfit` example now shows arrays and names `EquippedSlotsSchema` in `lib/schemas/wardrobe.types.ts` as the source of truth.

`help/character-editing.md` still described a vault `Outfits/` folder of saved presets with a four-slot `slots` map; `vault-readers.ts` has not read that folder since the rework. The vault-folder paragraph now covers what `buildWardrobeItemFile` actually writes, including the previously undocumented `imagePrompt` and `componentItems` frontmatter keys and the composite `replace` flag, plus the cycle and unknown-reference handling. Both files were reconciled with the new `hair` slot on merge.

#### The three character-generation systems now know every character bucket

The AI Wizard, Summon From Lore, and the Character Optimizer ("Refine from Memories") previously shared only a partial map of the character data model — the vantage-point preamble covering manifesto/identity/description/personality/title — and each had its own blind spots beyond that. `lib/services/character-field-semantics.ts` now carries the complete taxonomy: new prose blocks for system prompts (`PROMPT_SEMANTICS`), properties/pronouns/aliases (`PROPERTIES_SEMANTICS`), the physical description (nothing removable), and the wardrobe (slots, imagePrompt vs description, composites, defaults), plus a composed `FULL_FIELD_SEMANTICS`. All three systems consume the shared blocks instead of ad-hoc wording.

**AI Wizard** gains two new generatable fields: Properties (pronouns + aliases, with the same no-placeholder rule Summon uses) and First Message. Its context prompt now shows existing example dialogues, system prompt, first message, pronouns, and aliases (previously omitted even when present). Two bugs fixed: `wardrobeItems` was missing from the server-side request schema, so "Select all" failed the whole request with a validation error; and the wardrobe checkbox was absent from the field-selection step, making it unreachable. Generated properties persist via character PUT (staged into form state in the edit view); the generation preview renders wardrobe and properties results.

**Wardrobe generation** (Wizard + Summon, shared in new `lib/wardrobe/generated-items.ts`) now produces items with `imagePrompt` visual cues, marks the everyday set `isDefault` so a summoned character starts dressed, and generates 1–2 composite outfits whose components are referenced by title and resolved to real item ids at persistence time (leaf items created first).

**Summon From Lore**'s pronouns step now also extracts aliases; the review screen shows aliases and the wardrobe counts it previously omitted, and the step matrix includes the wardrobe step that was already running but never reported.

**Character Optimizer** now sees the whole character: title, pronouns, aliases, first message, and the full wardrobe inventory join its context, so suggestions stop colliding with what's already on record. Two new suggestion passes: Wardrobe (add a memory-established garment as a proper structured item, or refine an existing item's description — never bodily features, never deletions) and Aliases (additions only, one per suggestion; pronouns are read-only). The apply flow persists both through the wardrobe endpoints and the character PUT, and the suggestions-file dossier groups them under their own headings.

Help docs updated (`ai-character-import.md`, `character-optimizer.md`, `character-creation.md`); new unit coverage for the shared wardrobe helpers, composite assembly, and the new prompts.

#### The Salon's image-generation notice now clears itself (bug 77)

The `Generating image...` / `Successfully generated 1 image!` banner above the Salon composer had exactly one teardown — a detached `setTimeout` at the end of `sendMessage`'s terminal `onDone` — so any turn that finished another way (continue mode, an intermediate turn in a tool chain, an error) left it pinned above the composer for the rest of the session, with no way to close it. The notice now owns its own lifetime: a settled success/error status auto-dismisses after 6 seconds (timer held in a ref, superseded on each new status, cleared on unmount), turn boundaries drop only a `pending` status whose result never arrived, and the alert has a close button. Stopping a turn clears it immediately.

#### Importing a `.qtap` no longer breaks composite outfits (bug 75)

`importCharacterWardrobeItems` re-mints every wardrobe item id on import but passed `componentItemIds` through verbatim, so every composite outfit in an imported character kept references to ids that exist only in the export — equipping it cleared its slots and put nothing on, silently. The importer now pre-assigns the new ids, remaps composite references through the old→new map (dropping unresolvable ones with an import warning), creates leaf items before the composites that bundle them, and passes the pre-assigned id to `wardrobe.create`.

#### Three MODERN sample prompts for high-context models

The default-system-prompts plugin (1.1.17) gains three model-agnostic sample prompts written for modern 128K+ context models: `MODERN_GENERAL` (relationship-neutral — the character definition and story decide the dynamic), `MODERN_ROMANTIC` (romance-forward, with pacing discipline and guardrails against love-bombing and purple drift), and `MODERN_PLATONIC` (a companion prompt whose anti-romance guardrail is framed as character identity rather than a prohibition list, which holds up better over long contexts). All three lean on what current models do well — long-range callbacks, in-character refusal — and name the failure modes they drift into (assistant bleed, therapy-speak, echoing, uniform rhythm). The manifest's stale `promptCount` (10) was corrected to 21. `help/prompts.md` now describes the three groups of samples (MODERN, model-specific, GENERIC) and when to pick each.

#### Model-specific sample prompts modernized

The 16 model-specific prompts (CLAUDE / GPT5 / GPT4O / GEMINI / GROK / DEEPSEEK / MISTRAL / OLLAMA, companion + romantic) were rewritten around each family's dominant current failure mode rather than a shared anti-pattern list: Claude gets its assistant reflexes named as reflexes to override (caregiver swerve, tidy wrap-ups); GPT-5 gets an explicit output contract (no document structure, no closing offers, permission to be inefficient in the romantic register); GPT-4o gets anti-sycophancy discipline; Gemini gets a style governor against overwriting, "not X but Y" constructions, and long-context phrase looping; Grok gets wit calibration (sincerity without irony allowed); DeepSeek gets an escalation governor (pacing, metaphor budget, emotional continuity); Mistral gets pushed the opposite direction — initiative and interiority over flat economy; Ollama's stay short and imperative with a loop guard and updated sampler guidance. Every file now carries the never-write-{{user}} rule (previously missing from several), long-context callback guidance, and each model's structural dialect (XML tags for Claude/Gemini, `###` sections for DeepSeek). The GENERIC pair is unchanged; MODERN supersedes it for new characters.

#### Connection profiles can be tagged (bug 74)

Tagging a connection profile has never worked. `TagEditor` maps an entity type to an API base path, and the `profile` branch returned `/api/v1/profiles/<id>` — connection profiles are served from `/api/v1/connection-profiles`, and there has never been an `/api/v1/profiles` route. Every read and write 404'd. The read fails silently (the loader checks `res.ok` and simply doesn't set state), so the Tags section always looked empty; adding a tag created the tag but failed to attach it, with a generic "Failed to add tag" toast that gave no hint the URL was wrong.

Two further layers were only visible once the path was corrected.

The connection-profile GET had no `get-tags` action. It ignored the parameter and returned `{ profile: … }`, so `TagEditor` read `data.tags` as `undefined` and still showed nothing — with no error. It is now a real action returning `{ tags }`, and the GET refuses an unrecognised action with a 400 instead of falling through to the profile body. That leniency is exactly what hid this: a caller asking for something the route didn't implement got a 200 and the wrong shape. The POST on the same route was already strict.

And `ProfileCard` rendered the wrong shape. `enrichWithTags` — used by the collection endpoint the card renders from — returns `{ tagId, tag }` envelopes, but the card read `tag.id` and `tag.name` straight off them, so both were `undefined` and a tagged profile drew an empty pill. `ConnectionProfile.tags` was typed `Tag[]`, which is not what the wire carries; `fetchJson<any>` meant nothing checked. The client type now declares the envelope and the card unwraps it.

The last two are the same confusion twice: two tag shapes with no owner. Entity payloads carry `{ tagId, tag }`; `?action=get-tags` answers flat `{ id, name, visualStyle }` because that is what `TagEditor` and `TagBadge` consume. New `resolveEditorTags` in `lib/api/middleware/enrichment.ts` owns the flat projection, built on `enrichWithTags` so the batching and the "preserve the entity's own order" rule are stated once. The character route's `get-tags` moved onto it as well — those are the two answers `TagEditor` must read interchangeably — which also drops an N+1 there.

Not fixed, deliberately: `TagEditor`'s `chat` branch has the same missing `get-tags` action on the chats route. Nothing in the codebase passes `entityType="chat"`, so building it would be speculative; the requirement is recorded in the bug file instead.

#### A base URL no longer follows the profile onto a provider that hides it (bug 73)

Selecting Ollama or OpenAI-Compatible in the profile editor fills the Base URL box with that provider's default. Selecting a hosted provider next hid the box but kept the value, and all four outbound sites sent it whenever it was truthy rather than when the provider takes one. The result was a profile that could not connect — Connect returned `Failed to validate connection to OpenAI` with a valid key, Fetch Models failed, and the save wrote `http://localhost:11434` onto the row — with the offending value not rendered anywhere on the provider it broke, and no gesture to clear it. Merely browsing the provider dropdown was enough to trigger it.

`outboundBaseUrl()` in `useProfileForm.ts` is now the one answer to what may leave the form: `''` for a provider the list says takes none, the field's value otherwise. `handleConnect`, `handleFetchModels` and `handleTestMessage` read it instead of `formData.baseUrl`. A provider missing from the list is not evidence of anything — it hasn't loaded, or its fetch failed — so the stored value is kept there rather than clearing a working profile on a failed fetch.

`buildRequestBody` drops its `if (baseUrl)` guard and always sends the key, carrying `''` for a provider that takes none. This is deliberate: the update handler gates on `baseUrl !== undefined`, so omitting the key would leave every already-poisoned row untouched. An empty string maps to NULL on both the create and the update path, which makes the next ordinary save the cure for a profile broken before this fix.

Two further reads judged a provider by a base URL it may not own and were gated the same way — the edit-time model fetch (a stored row can still carry a stale URL until its first save) and the `supportsMimeType` / `getAttachmentSupportDescription` pair, which infer vision and attachment support partly from the endpoint.

`handleProviderChange` is unchanged. The value stays in form state, so switching back to a provider that shows the field restores it; the stale URL is inert rather than destructive, and no rule is needed about whether a typed URL outranks an auto-filled one.

Covered by `__tests__/unit/components/settings/profile-modal-base-url.test.tsx` — the real modal over the real hook, driven through the dropdown with `fetchJson` captured.

#### Clearing a numeric provider option leaves it clear (bug 72)

Every numeric field in the provider-options panel — Ollama's Request Timeout, the whole Sampling group, the OpenAI-compatible endpoint options — snapped back to its schema default the instant it was emptied, with the caret left after the restored value. Clearing `300` and typing `5` produced `3005`, and `3005` was stored and sent. The three behaviors were individually correct: an empty input emits `undefined`, `setParameter` treats `undefined` as delete-the-key, and `fieldValue` falls back to `field.default` when the key is absent. Clearing the field was self-canceling.

`NumberField` now holds its own draft string and renders that. A half-typed number isn't a value the parameter bag can hold — `1.` and `-` both arrive as `''` — so an input that re-derives its display from what the host stored will fight the person typing. A `syncedFrom` companion records the prop the draft was last reconciled against and is set on every write-through to the value the host will hand back, so the component can tell its own echo from the parameter genuinely moving underneath it (a different profile, a schema swap). The simpler re-sync-when-the-prop-changes spelling reintroduces the bug for any field that had a stored value before the clear.

`fieldValue` now returns `undefined` rather than `field.default` for number fields, and `NumberField` renders the default as the input's placeholder. An unset numeric option therefore shows an empty box with the default behind it in grey, instead of the default sitting in the box as though someone had chosen it. That closes the bug's second consequence: absent and explicitly-default no longer look identical, "leave blank for the default" is a state the user can see themselves reach, and a blank field round-trips as absent — so a later change to a plugin's default still reaches profiles that never set one. Every other control keeps the fallback as a real value; `EnumField` relies on it to preselect.

Covered by five cases in `__tests__/unit/components/settings/provider-options-panel.test.tsx`, driven through a host that reproduces `ProfileModal`'s delete-on-`undefined` `setParameter`.

#### Local providers send the profile's parameters, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints can call tools (bug 71)

`connection_profiles.parameters` is free-form JSON: any key saves and reloads cleanly. Ollama read three of them and hardcoded the rest of its `options` object; the OpenAI-compatible provider never read the blob at all and declared no options schema. Everything else was dropped on the way to the wire without a log line, so no local model could be run at the sampling settings its own publisher specifies, and `reasoning_effort` — exposed on DeepSeek and Z.AI — was unreachable on the two providers where wall-clock control matters most.

`applyProfileParameters(body, params, allowlist, normalize?)` in `@quilltap/plugin-utils` 2.3.0 is now the one mechanism. It is an exported function rather than a base-class method because only DeepSeek extends `OpenAICompatibleProvider` — Z.AI, OpenRouter and Ollama implement their providers directly and reach it by composition. Keys are allow-listed, never spread, so `model`, `messages`, `stream` and `tools` stay unreachable from a profile; `undefined`, `null` and the empty string omit the key. `OpenAICompatibleProvider` gained `profileParamAllowlist` (empty by default, so every subclass is byte-identical on the wire until it opts in) and an overridable `normalizeProfileParam`. DeepSeek and Z.AI dropped their hand-rolled copies of the same loop.

**OpenAI-compatible** (plugin 1.0.40) gets its first provider options schema: Reasoning Effort, Top K, Min P, Repeat Penalty, Presence Penalty, Frequency Penalty, Seed, Reuse Cached Prompt. Reasoning Effort is **not** sent as a top-level key — it is folded into `chat_template_kwargs`, which is how `llama-server` reaches a Jinja template's arguments; a flat key parses fine and is never seen by the template.

**Ollama** (plugin 1.0.43) widens `options` to `top_k`, `min_p`, `repeat_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `seed` and the mirostat trio, and gains two top-level settings. **Keep Model Loaded** sets `keep_alive` per profile, so a large chat model can stay resident while a small utility model unloads at once; it defaults to sending nothing at all, which leaves any `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` on the server in charge. **Thinking Effort** appears when Enable Thinking is on and sends `think` as a level rather than a boolean. Both were measured against a live Ollama 0.32.1 rather than assumed: an unknown think level is rejected outright by the server, and `keep_alive: "-1"` is rejected as a duration while the number `-1` is honoured, so the numeric sentinels go out as numbers. `num_ctx` and the existing thinking/timeout keys now route through the same table, so there is one answer to what a profile may set.

Separately, the OpenAI-compatible provider could never call a tool: its capability is `false` *and* its request bodies had no `tools` key. The capability stays `false` — an arbitrary endpoint is the conservative case — but it is now a default rather than a ceiling. It seeds a new profile's "Allow tool use" checkbox, which was already editable, and the provider now sends `tools`/`tool_choice` when the caller supplies tools and parses `tool_calls` back on both paths (index-keyed accumulation of streamed argument fragments). An endpoint that does not in fact support tools fails visibly rather than falling back silently.

No migration and no export-schema change: `parameters` was already free-form JSON and already round-trips.

#### Max Tokens and Top P from the profile are actually sent

A connection profile stores its sampling knobs under the keys the editor writes: `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`. The Salon's streaming path read `modelParams.maxTokens` and `modelParams.topP` — camelCase names that do not exist in that blob — so two of the three came out `undefined` on every turn and the provider fell back to its own defaults. On Ollama that meant `num_predict: 4096` and `top_p: 1` regardless of what the profile said, and the profile card in Settings displayed figures that were never used.

Regenerate/swipe read the same blob correctly, so the two paths disagreed: the original reply used the provider defaults and a regeneration of that same reply used the profile. The greeting path had the camelCase bug too, on both its normal and its Concierge-uncensored branch.

`resolveSamplingParams` (`lib/llm/sampling-params.ts`) is now the one place that maps a parameters blob to the three `LLMParams` fields — canonical snake_case first, camelCase tolerated for a hand-edited or imported blob, absent knobs left undefined so nothing is invented. The streaming service, regenerate/swipe, the greeting path, and the image-description fallback all go through it. Do not read `parameters.max_tokens` at a call site again.

Not to be confused with `resolveMaxTokens` in `model-context-data.ts`, which deliberately ignores `parameters.max_tokens`: that one sizes the context budget's response reserve, this one is the per-request generation cap on the wire.

Covered by `lib/llm/__tests__/sampling-params.test.ts`. One consequence worth knowing: a profile carrying a large Max Tokens has been ignored until now and will be honoured from here on.

#### Ollama profiles can set their own request timeout

An Ollama turn was bounded by the shared 5-minute default in `@quilltap/plugin-utils` with nothing in the UI to change it. On a streaming call that budget covers only the wait for the first token — but loading a large model off disk and evaluating a long prompt both happen inside that silence. A 27B model on a 20k-token prompt, roused cold on a busy machine, ran 220–295 seconds per turn against a 300-second ceiling; the turn that finally crossed it died with `AbortError: This operation was aborted` and left no assistant message in the chat at all.

The Ollama plugin (1.0.42) gains a **Request Timeout (seconds)** field on the connection profile, stored as `request_timeout_seconds` and applied by `resolveProfileTimeoutMs` to both the streaming first-byte timer and the non-streaming whole-request signal. Blank, absent, or unparseable falls through to 300, so nothing changes for a profile that never touches it. A caller-supplied `LLMParams.requestTimeoutMs` still wins, keeping the cheap-LLM task deadlines a hard ceiling.

#### The context budget honors the profile's Max Context (bug 70)

A profile whose model name isn't in Quilltap's lookup tables — any `hf.co/...` Ollama tag, any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint — was budgeted at 8192 tokens no matter what Max Context said. Conversation history was trimmed to fit that figure on every turn, silently, and the only signal was a "Conversation is getting long" warning that fires exclusively when history has just been dropped.

The window was resolved two different ways in the same function. `calculateContextBudget` used a model-name lookup (`getModelContextLimit`), which falls through to the 8192 OLLAMA/OPENAI_COMPATIBLE default for an unknown name; `calculateMaxAvailable`, 270 lines later, read `profile.maxContext` and saw the real value. One live turn resolved 8192 and 65536 seconds apart. The small figure won everywhere it did damage: it drove `systemPromptBudget`, `recentMessagesBudget`, and the remaining-budget math that feeds `selectRecentMessages`. Compression, working from the correct number, rightly did nothing — so the logs paired an apparent overage with `compressionApplied: false`, which reads like a compression failure and isn't one. The pre-send validation warning derived its limit from the same corrupt figure, so it confirmed the bad number instead of catching it.

`resolveContextWindow(provider, modelName, profile)` in `lib/llm/model-context-data.ts` is now the single source of truth: the profile's `maxContext` wins, the name lookup is the fallback, and a zero or negative column falls through rather than producing a zero-token budget. `getRecommendedContextAllocation`, `getSafeInputLimit`, and `calculateMaxAvailable` all route through it, `calculateContextBudget` takes the profile, and `buildContext` passes `options.connectionProfile`. `external-prompt-generator.service.ts` had the same blind spot on the character-prompt path and now passes its profile too.

For the reported 65536-token profile the budget goes from 8192 to 65536, the history allowance from roughly 1.5k tokens to 32768, and the spurious warning stops.

Two adjacent gaps in the same accounting were fixed alongside it.

**The builder and the validator now use one ceiling.** The builder filled to `totalLimit − responseReserve` while the pre-send check warned above `totalLimit − responseReserve − 10%`, so a context packed exactly as instructed could be reported as an overage. `computeSafeInputLimit` owns that formula now; `ContextBudget` carries `safeInputLimit` and `safetyMargin`, the builder's `remainingBudget` derives from it, and the orchestrator reads it instead of recomputing.

**The budget now counts the whole payload.** Tool schemas ride alongside the message array and were never counted at all — thousands of tokens on a full roster, and on a small window more than the conversation. Agent-mode instructions and the tool-change notice were spliced in after the budget had been spent. All three are known before the context is built, so new `lib/services/chat-message/turn-extras.ts` builds and measures them in one place: the total is passed to the builder as `reservedOutgoingTokens` and held back from the message budget, the tool schemas are added to the pre-send estimate, and the same strings it built are spliced in rather than reconstructed at the splice site. `countToolSchemaTokens` measures the serialized form, so it works for both provider tool shapes, and returns 0 instead of throwing on a definition that won't serialize.

One consequence: with the reservation subtracted, a large character on a small window can leave no room for history at all. That case now warns by name instead of silently sending a character with no memory of the exchange.

#### Archived characters can be rehydrated again (bug 69)

Rehydrating an archived character failed with "the bundle's decrypted content does not match its recorded digest — the bundle is corrupt". The bundle was fine; its database row was not.

An archive bundle is written encrypted, but its `files` row records the digest of the *decrypted* content — that is the digest that survives a passphrase change and actually verifies the contents. The filesystem watcher knew nothing of that: it re-derives `sha256` and `size` from disk for any file that changes, and it saw the bundle land seconds after the row was created. From then on the row held the digest of the encrypted bytes, and the verification on rehydrate could never pass again. Archiving was effectively one-way. The boot reconciliation had the same hole on its size-mismatch path, which is exactly the case a re-encryption produces.

Which rows may have their digest re-derived from disk is now decided in one place, `lib/file-storage/digest-policy.ts`, and both the watcher and the reconciliation ask it; archive rows keep their digest and still get their size corrected. For bundles already spoiled, rehydration self-heals: if the recorded digest is exactly the digest of the file as stored, the bytes are intact and the row is the damaged part — it is repaired, a warning is reported, and the rehydrate proceeds. Any other mismatch is still refused as corrupt.

Verified live: archive → rehydrate now round-trips cleanly, and a row clobbered by the old code rehydrates with the repair warning.

#### A send from the composer's raw-Markdown view no longer discards the edits (bug 67)

The Salon composer's source toggle swaps a plain `<textarea>` in front of the Lexical editor, which stays mounted but hidden with its sync bridge suspended. The submit path read the editor handle unconditionally, so a message sent from the source view shipped the editor's pre-toggle document and every source edit was silently dropped — no error, and the composer cleared as though the send had worked.

Which surface is authoritative now lives in one place, `app/salon/[id]/composer-source-mode.ts`. `resolveComposerSubmitText` sends the textarea's text while the source view is showing and the editor handle otherwise; `resolveComposerHasContent` gates the Send button on the same visible surface, instead of on a presence flag the suspended editor is no longer updating. Post-send clearing already covered both surfaces.

Two adjacent gaps are unchanged and were not part of this fix: Ctrl/Cmd+Enter does nothing in the source textarea (the keyboard send lives in the hidden editor's plugin, so the Send button is the only send route there), and source-view edits are outside draft persistence, which is fed by the editor.

Covered by `__tests__/unit/app/salon/composer-source-mode.test.ts`.

#### The Archived badge shows on a chat's first load (bug 66)

A chat seating an archived character showed no **Archived** badge in the participant sidebar. Two enrichment paths project the same character, and the character-archive work extended only one: the chat GET that the sidebar renders from goes through `getCharacterDetail`, which never carried `archivedAt`. It now does, on both of its return paths — including the chat-avatar-override return an archived seat with a wardrobe-generated avatar takes — and the enriched type declares the field so it cannot be dropped silently again.

Verifying against a live instance turned up a second link in the same chain: `useParticipants` rebuilds each participant's character field by field for the sidebar card and dropped the tombstone again, so the badge could not light on any path, not just a fresh load. Both projections now carry it. The archived seat took no turns either way; the badge was the only casualty.

#### Multi-character `[Name]` prefill is now a per-profile setting (bug 68)

In a multi-character chat, every reply is anchored to the character whose turn it is by one of two routes: an assistant message prefilled with `[Character Name]` (the model structurally continues only that line; the tag is stripped downstream), or a prose instruction appended to the system prompt. Until now the route was hardcoded by provider — Anthropic got the prose branch because 4.6+ rejects a request ending on an assistant message, and everything else got the prefill.

That was wrong for Ollama. Ollama's `think` support is implemented in the model's chat template, which opens the thinking block at the *start* of the assistant turn — so a prefill means the block is never opened and `message.thinking` comes back empty however the profile's **Enable Thinking** box is set. Reproduced against `localhost:11434` on `hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`: identical request, no prefill → 470 thinking characters, with prefill → 0. The 8B shows the uglier variant — it reasons anyway, the opening tag is gone, and an orphan `</think>` leaks into the reply (caught by the think-parser's swallowed-tag rule). Other providers are unaffected because their reasoning arrives in a protocol field rather than a template artifact; in one instance's history, DeepSeek carried reasoning on 1742 of 5689 multi-character turns while Ollama managed 0 of 12.

Connection profiles gain a `multiCharacterPrefill` column and an **Announce the speaker in multi-character scenes ([Name] prefill)** checkbox. Migration `add-profile-multi-character-prefill-field-v1` backfills existing rows to preserve today's behaviour exactly: Anthropic profiles off, everything else on. New profiles seed from the provider default, and switching provider on an unsaved profile re-seeds it. The hardcoded Anthropic branch in `context-builder.service.ts` is gone; the anchor is now applied by `applyMultiCharacterTurnAnchor`, and the setting is resolved through the single chokepoint `profileUsesNamePrefill` (`lib/llm/multi-character-prefill.ts`) — never read the column directly, because NULL means "never chosen" (a pre-migration row, or a profile imported from a pre-4.9 bundle) and resolves to the provider default. Ticking the box on an Anthropic profile is allowed but warned about in the editor, since it will 400 on every multi-character turn.

The `finalizeMessageResponse()` truncation at the first foreign speaker tag remains the structural backstop on both routes, and single-character chats use neither.

#### Generated opening greetings keep their reasoning

`generateGreetingMessage` consumed the provider's stream reading `chunk.content` and nothing else, so a thinking model's reasoning while composing a greeting was discarded — one observed greeting cost 3620 characters of reasoning and rendered no thinking fold. The chunk loop now tracks `reasoningContent` (cumulative, so assignment rather than concatenation, matching the Salon's streaming contract), `GreetingResult` and `autoGenerateFirstMessage` carry it through all four generation attempts, and it is persisted onto the greeting message. Display only, like every other stored reasoning.

#### Logs: background-job child debug lines no longer appear as info

The parent process re-emits every log record the forked job child sends it, so all output lands in one `combined.log` with a single writer. That relay only handled `error`, `warn`, and `info`, and sent everything else — `debug` and `trace` — through `log.info`. Since most of the image pipeline, memory extraction, and autonomous turns run in the child, a large share of the file's `"level":"info"` lines were actually debug output, making level-based triage unreliable. The relay now maps `trace` and `debug` to their own levels and re-emits anything unrecognized at debug rather than info. Log volume is unchanged: the child inherits `LOG_LEVEL` through `fork` and already filters before sending.

#### Ollama: Enable Thinking profile option, and `<think>` blocks routed to the thinking display

The Ollama plugin (1.0.41) gains an **Enable Thinking** checkbox in the connection profile's provider options, default off. The setting maps to Ollama's top-level `think` request parameter on both streaming and non-streaming calls: off asks thinking-capable models (Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.) to answer directly — the clean-output mode you want for JSON-shaped work — and on lets them reason first. Older Ollama servers ignore the unknown field. If a model rejects the parameter outright (some cannot disable thinking), the request is retried once without it instead of failing.

Reasoning now reaches the Salon's thinking fold from both channels Ollama uses. When the server parses the model's template, reasoning arrives on the separate `message.thinking` field, which the plugin previously dropped on the floor; it now streams into `reasoningContent` cumulatively, the same way DeepSeek's does. When the server *can't* parse the template — common with community GGUF imports — the raw `<think>...</think>` block leaks straight into the content stream; a new stateful splitter (`think-parser.ts`) recognizes those blocks even when a tag straddles streaming chunk boundaries, routes their text to the thinking display, and keeps them out of the visible message, the stored content, and tool-call parsing. Responses with no think blocks pass through byte-for-byte. An unterminated block at end-of-stream counts as reasoning.

The splitter also handles the swallowed-opening-tag pattern, live-reproduced against `hf.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M`: in no-think mode that model reasons anyway, and Ollama eats the opening `<think>`, so the content arrives as untagged reasoning followed by an orphan `</think>` and then the real answer — which was corrupting cheap-LLM JSON tasks (memory extraction, summarization) pointed at it. A closing tag encountered before any think block and before any visible output now reclassifies everything ahead of it as reasoning, fully cleaning the non-streaming path cheap-LLM tasks use. Once real content has been emitted (or a real think block was seen), a stray closing tag stays in the content; mid-stream, content already emitted before the orphan tag arrives cannot be recalled.

Covered by a new unit suite (`ollama-thinking.test.ts`: parser chop tests at several chunk sizes, native-channel streaming, the retry fallback, non-streaming extraction, the swallowed-open reproduction), and the Ollama schema joins the provider-options snapshot test.

#### Ollama: Max Context now drives the server's context window, and the provider declares tool support

Two follow-ups in the same plugin release (still 1.0.41):

**`num_ctx` from Max Context.** An Ollama server allocates its own default context window (typically 4k–32k) unless the request carries `options.num_ctx` — the Modelfile rarely sets it. Quilltap, meanwhile, budgeted prompts against the profile's Max Context, so a profile set to 262144 against a server loading 32768 meant every long chat was silently middle-truncated by the server with no error anywhere. Verified live: the Qwen3.8-27B GGUF loaded at 32768 despite the model supporting 262144. Now `profileParams()` (`lib/llm/cheap-llm.ts`) injects `num_ctx` from the profile's Max Context for Ollama profiles, and the plugin forwards it on both streaming and non-streaming calls — the window Quilltap budgets against is the window the server actually allocates. An explicit `num_ctx` already in the parameters blob wins; profiles with no Max Context keep the server default, exactly as before. The eight call sites that built `profileParameters` inline from `profile.parameters` (Salon orchestrator, regenerate-swipe, greeting, answer-confirmation, image-description fallback, wardrobe analysis, uncensored extraction, announcer) were converted to the shared helper, so the injection — and any future per-provider parameter — applies uniformly. Note: changing Max Context on an Ollama profile now triggers a model reload on the next call (context size is a load-time property), and Max Context should be sized to fit RAM — the KV cache scales linearly with it.

**Tool capability.** The plugin's `capabilities.toolUse` flips false → true. The provider has long forwarded native tool definitions and normalized `tool_calls`, and modern local models handle them (verified live on both Qwen3 GGUFs, including with thinking enabled). The flag's only effect is the profile editor's default for the *Allow tool use* checkbox on newly created Ollama profiles — it now defaults ticked; the checkbox remains the per-profile gate either way, and existing profiles keep their saved setting.

#### Help search now matches sections, and the Guide's search box now reads the text

Two separate reasons a search of the built-in help came back empty.

**The Guide tab's search box only ever matched titles.** `HelpGuideTab` filtered the topic list on `doc.title.toLowerCase().includes(query)` and never touched the document body — the index shipped to the client carries titles and URLs only. Any term living in the prose ("describe", "uncensored", "timeout") returned nothing at all. Document content is far too large to ship with the index, so the match now runs server-side: `GET /api/v1/help-docs?action=search&q=…` does a case-insensitive substring pass over titles and content and returns matching slugs with a ~180-character snippet centred on the hit. The client debounces at 200 ms, keeps its instant title-only filter for the first keystroke, and shows the snippet under each topic so a body-text match explains itself. Results are tagged with the query that produced them, so a stale response can't leak into a newer query's filter.

**`help_search` scored whole documents.** Help docs were embedded one vector per file. For a 700-line page spanning a dozen subsystems, that single vector is a smear that matches no specific question strongly, and the tool then handed the model the *first* 1000 characters of the file — a table of contents, never the answer. Both halves are fixed:

- A new `help_doc_chunks` table holds section-level slices, rebuilt from disk whenever a doc's content hash changes (migration `create-help-doc-chunks-table-v1`). The slicing reuses the Scriptorium's Markdown-aware chunker at smaller targets (400–700 tokens, 100 overlap); each chunk is embedded with its document title and nearest heading prefixed, so "Uncensored fallback profile" carries the context of the page around it.
- Chunk vectors are written by the same `HELP_DOC` embedding job that writes the whole-document one. That was deliberate: the reindex enqueue, the `embedding_status` bookkeeping, and the dimension reconcile all still count `help_docs` rows, and a chunk can never carry a dimension its parent doesn't. Chunks that already hold a vector are skipped, so a retried job is cheap; a single chunk's failure is logged and skipped rather than failing a job whose main work succeeded.
- `HelpSearch.search` scores every chunk, keeps the best per document, and ranks each document by `max(docScore, bestSectionScore)` — the whole-document score stays in play so a broadly on-topic page isn't buried by an unlucky slicing, and docs with no chunks yet still rank. Results carry a `matchedSection`, and `formatHelpSearchResults` now leads with that section (1500 chars) followed by a shorter document excerpt (600) instead of 1000 characters from the top of the file.
- Section scoring is wrapped so any failure — missing table, unreadable rows — falls back to whole-document scoring with a warning rather than breaking help search.

`help_doc_chunks` joins the embedding sweeps that walk tables by name: `reapply-profile`'s `MAIN_DB_TABLES`, `repair-text-embeddings`' table list, and a full reindex's up-front embedding clear.

Existing instances needed a backfill after all, which runtime verification caught: `ensureHelpDocsSynced` only re-syncs when the *set of paths* on disk diverges from the table, so an upgraded instance has every content hash matching, skips every file, and would have left the chunk table empty forever — section search silently never engaging. `backfillHelpDocChunks` now slices any already-synced document when the chunk table is empty (one count query per boot thereafter, not a scan — chunk rows carry embedding BLOBs) and enqueues the `HELP_DOC` jobs that fill the vectors, since the documents' own embeddings are already present and would otherwise enqueue nothing. Measured on a real instance: 588 chunks across 120 documents, embedded within a minute.

While extracting the shared enqueue helper, `enqueueMissingHelpDocEmbeddings` briefly lost the try/catch around its repository lookup; restored, with its own log line.

#### Docs: rewrote the image-description help, which was wrong on two points and silent on a third

`help/chat-settings.md`'s "Image Description Settings" section described a version of the feature that no longer exists. It called the dropdown "Image Description Provider" (the UI says "Primary image description profile"), it claimed the blank option disabled image descriptions entirely (blank means auto-select, preferring a profile marked Cheap), and it never mentioned the uncensored fallback profile at all — a second dropdown in the same settings card, with real behavior behind it.

The section now covers: what triggers the fallback path (the responding profile's vision checkbox being unticked, not the provider's identity); the reuse chain that skips the vision call entirely for generated images and for uploads that already carry a description; what the auto-select actually picks; the uncensored fallback and the refusal heuristic that invokes it; the `IMAGE_DESCRIPTION` entry in the LLM logs; and the one-minute timeout. The "Image descriptions missing" troubleshooting entry was rewritten to match, and now covers refusals and timeouts rather than only missing configuration.

Also corrected the Cheap LLM section, which listed "Image descriptions" among the operations the cheap profile drives. Image description never consults `cheapLLMSettings` — it only prefers a profile marked Cheap when auto-selecting a describer.

`help/help-chat.md` documents the Guide search box now reading document text rather than titles alone.
