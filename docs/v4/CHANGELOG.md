# Quilltap Changelog

## Recent Changes

### 4.10-dev

#### Fixed: story backgrounds no longer re-dress characters the concealment prompt should drape

- The Concierge's appearance sanitizer rewrote explicit appearances by substituting clothing
  ("wearing nothing" → "wearing casual clothes") before the story-background prompt crafter ran.
  The crafter's concealment guidance forbids exactly that substitution, so a sanitized character
  reached it already dressed and was rendered as a different scene.
- `sanitizeAppearancesIfNeeded` / `sanitizeAppearance` take a `mode`. Story backgrounds pass
  `'conceal'`: the rewrite removes explicit wording but keeps the character's state, and reports
  `undressed`, which sets `needsConcealment` on the appearance. The handler appends
  `CONCEALMENT_MARKER` to that character's description.
- The concealed crafter prompt gains a per-character requirement: every character carrying the
  marker, or described as nude/naked/topless/undressed, must get at least one concealment
  technique and must not be dressed. Previously the model applied concealment unevenly and could
  pass a bare "topless" through.
- The `generate_image` tool keeps the default `'redress'` mode; its prompt expander has no
  concealment guidance to act on the marker.

#### Fixed: characters added to a running chat keep their default avatar

- Adding a character to an existing chat (or re-adding a removed one) now requests a per-chat
  avatar for their current outfit, as chat creation already did for the opening cast. Previously
  the joining character showed their default avatar until their next wardrobe change.
- Gated on the chat's avatar-generation setting and skipped in autonomous rooms, like other
  automatic triggers. The request runs through the normal avatar job, so an outfit that already
  has a cached avatar is rebound without a new image generation.
- `refreshAvatarForArrivingCharacter` in `app/api/v1/chats/[id]/actions/participants.ts`.

#### Changed: built-in character prompts teach listening and register

- All 21 sample system prompts (`qtap-plugin-default-system-prompts` 1.1.24) now tell the
  character to respond to what the speaker means: jokes answered in kind, exaggeration not taken
  literally, offhand remarks not mined for subtext, and a question when seriousness is unclear.
  They also size replies to the input, skip paraphrasing, ration signature habits and the
  "not X — Y" construction, and reserve formal language for moments that call for it.
- Each prompt ends with short example exchanges (a joke caught, a casual line answered briefly,
  a serious moment). Every file uses different lines, and the examples are marked as showing
  shape only, not voice or shared history.
- The prompt-template seeder now refreshes existing built-in rows when the shipped text changes.
  It used to insert only missing rows, so revised samples never reached existing installs.
  Prompts already imported into characters are copies and are not changed.
- The AI Wizard and Summon From Lore add the same listening and register direction to generated
  system prompts, and require generated example dialogues to cover a joke, a casual line, and a
  serious moment (`CONVERSATIONAL_VOICE_DIRECTION` / `EXAMPLE_DIALOGUE_COVERAGE` in
  `lib/services/character-field-semantics.ts`).
- The Character Optimizer no longer writes a habit that appears in most replies into a field as a
  trait, keeps a system prompt's listening and register direction when refining it, and applies
  the same example-dialogue coverage.

#### Added: Import from Image offers an outfit

- The wardrobe image analysis now also asks the vision model to name the ensemble
  (`outfit: { title, description, appropriateness }`). The analyze-image endpoint returns it as
  `proposedOutfit`, or `null` when the model names none, returns it without a title, or finds
  fewer than two items. A bad outfit block never fails the analysis.
- The review screen has an "Also create an outfit from these pieces" card, on by default when the
  model named one and available whenever two or more items are selected. After the pieces are
  created, their returned ids become the composite's `componentItemIds` and its `types` are their
  union (`unionTypes`). No ids are assigned up front. The outfit defaults to `replace: true`.
- If fewer than two pieces are created, or the outfit post fails, the imported pieces are kept and
  an error toast says the outfit was not made.

#### Changed: old conversations keep their embeddings; transcripts rendered on demand

- The stale-chat sweep no longer clears `conversation_chunks.embedding`. On `Friday` it had
  cleared 85% of all chunks (every chat idle more than 30 days), which removed those chats from
  semantic search, to save about 14 MB. Keeping every chunk embedded costs about 16 MB there.
- The startup render reconcile, the embedding reindex and the dimension reconcile no longer skip
  stale chats. On the first boot after this change the reconcile enqueues a render (and so a
  re-embed) for every chat that had been cold-tiered. On `Friday` that is about 13k chunks.
- `chats.renderedMarkdown` is dropped (`drop-chat-rendered-markdown-v1`). Chat rows are always
  read whole, so every chat list carried every stored transcript (about 160 KB each). The
  transcript is now rendered from the messages when needed (`renderChatConversation`,
  `lib/scriptorium/render-chat.ts`), used by the render job, `read_conversation` and
  `upsert_annotation`. `read_conversation` previously failed on any chat the sweep had collapsed.
- The render job resolves speaker names through `resolveSpeakerNames`. A character with a broken
  vault now costs a label instead of failing the render.
- The Scriptorium badge status is derived from chunks alone (`deriveScriptoriumStatus`,
  `lib/scriptorium/status.ts`), used by both chat-list endpoints. Before this, a collapsed chat
  showed red "Not yet rendered" even after its embeddings were restored.
- Chat card badges and the delete/remove button use the in-app `Tooltip` instead of the native
  `title` attribute, which was unreliable under Electron.

#### Added: `discard_mail`

- `discard_mail({ letter })` deletes a letter from the caller's own `Mail/` folder by file name,
  regardless of `systemTransparency`. It deletes through `discardLetter` →
  `deleteDatabaseDocumentIfExists`, the same `deleteWithGC` chokepoint as `doc_delete_file`: a
  hard-linked letter loses only its link, a one-member link group is dissolved, and the file row
  is collected when no link remains. In the job child the delete is buffered and replayed on the
  parent.
- Added to `DESTRUCTIVE_TOOL_NAMES`, so autonomous rooms drop it unless destructive tools are
  allowed.
- The letter actions in `list_mail`, `read_mail` and Suparṇā's notice now offer `discard_mail`
  instead of `doc_delete_file`. No Librarian delete announcement is posted.

#### Added: `read_mail`; `list_email` renamed to `list_mail`

- Characters without `systemTransparency` could list and send mail but not read it: the
  instructions pointed at `doc_read_file({ uri: "qtap://self/Mail/…" })`, and the opacity covenant
  refuses `self` for them. The new `read_mail({ letter })` tool takes a letter's bare file name,
  confines it to the caller's own `Mail/` folder, and reads through `ensureCharacterVault` like
  `list_mail` does, so transparency never applies. Reading an unannounced letter marks it announced.
- `list_email` is now `list_mail`. The old name is not aliased.
- `list_mail`, `read_mail` and Suparṇā's delivery notice name letters by file name. `send_mail`'s
  `in_reply_to` accepts the file name as well as the `Mail/…` path and stores the path. The shared
  parser is `resolveMailPath` in `lib/post-office/mailbox.ts`; it also accepts the
  `qtap://self/Mail/…` form and rejects anything outside `Mail/`.

#### Fixed: Continue Elsewhere left the cast talking to people who stayed behind (bug 171)

- The carryover drops the lines of anyone not seated in the new chat but keeps everyone else's
  lines to them, so the new cast read an absent character as present and silent. Found on
  `Friday`: an autonomous room continued from a chat Charlie was in spent 16 turns addressing him.
- `applyChatContinuation` now names every source-chat participant (any status but `removed`) who
  is not seated in the new chat. It posts the notice after the replayed messages, through
  `postHostOffSceneCharactersAnnouncement` with the new `reason: 'left-behind'`. The IDs are stamped
  in `introducedCharacterIds`, so the per-turn off-scene scan does not introduce them again. The
  operator's unseated persona is skipped where it is still in the room (see bug 172).
- A character whose vault cannot be read is skipped with a warning; the continuation still
  completes. The result gains `leftBehindCharacterIds`.

#### Fixed: autonomous rooms never introduced the operator's persona as absent (bug 172)

- The off-scene introduction excluded the user persona by name. In an autonomous room, that name
  is the system-wide sole user-controlled character, the `resolveUserIdentity` step-2 fallback.
  Nobody types as that character there, so it was the one absent person the Host could never flag.
- New `operatorSpeaksWithoutSeat(chatType)` in `lib/schemas/chat.types.ts` (false only for
  `'autonomous'`) gates that exclusion in `buildContext`. New `isUserPersonaInRoom(chat, identity)`
  in `user-identity-resolver.service.ts` answers the same question for a resolved identity.
- `{{user}}` still resolves to the fallback persona in autonomous rooms; templates are unchanged.

#### Added: Scenario Builder on the scenario shelves

- The **Ask the Host to set the scene** button now also appears on the General Scenarios page,
  on a project's Scenarios card, and on a group's Scenarios card. Launched there, the dialog has
  no "Use this scene"; "Save as scenario…" is the primary action.
- From a shelf, the save dialog offers every home: General, every project, every group, and every
  non-archived character. The shelf the builder was opened from is preselected. The shelf's list
  refreshes after each save.
- The builder's store pool follows the shelf: General only; the project's stores plus General; or
  the group's official and linked stores plus General. New `groupIds` field on
  `POST /api/v1/scenario-builder?action=build`; unknown group ids are dropped. New helper
  `resolveMountPointIdsForGroup` in `lib/mount-index/tiered-mount-pool.ts`, now also used by
  `resolveGroupMountPointIdsForCharacter`.
- Groups get a Scenarios card on their page (`GroupScenariosCard`), using the shared
  `ScenariosManager` over the existing `/api/v1/groups/[id]/scenarios` API. Previously the group
  page had no scenarios UI.
- Save-dialog target keys are now `project:<id>` rather than `project` in every mode.
- New query key `queryKeys.groups.list()`.

#### Changed: dependency update across the app, packages and plugins

`npm update -S` was run on the root project, every package under `packages/`, and all 15 distributed
plugins. No behavior changes are intended and no code changed.

- Root: Next and `eslint-config-next` 16.3.5 to 16.3.6, `openai` 7.20 to 7.23, `@openrouter/sdk`
  1.3.11 to 1.3.28, `katex` 0.18.7 to 0.18.9, `@quilltap/plugin-utils` ^2.6.2,
  `create-quilltap-theme` ^2.0.20.
- Packages published: `@quilltap/plugin-utils` 2.6.3 (`@quilltap/plugin-types` ^2.8.0, `openai`
  ^7.23.0). `plugin-types` and `theme-storybook` changed only their lockfiles and were not bumped.
- All 15 plugins took a patch bump in both `package.json` and `manifest.json`, mostly for
  `@quilltap/plugin-types` ^2.8.0 and `@quilltap/plugin-utils` ^2.6.2 (plus `openai`,
  `@openrouter/sdk` and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30.1 where used), and were rebuilt with
  `npm run build:plugins`.

#### Added: Salon polish for the Concierge (Concierge overhaul, phase 5)

- **Try uncensored, text.** New action `POST /api/v1/chats/[id]/messages/[messageId]?action=retry-uncensored`
  (`&stream=1` for the regeneration's SSE narration). Regenerates the assistant message as a new
  swipe on the Concierge's uncensored understudy (`resolveUncensoredTextUnderstudy`, excluding the
  responder's profile and every profile on the original's trail). Same inform semantics as a
  swipe. The new swipe's `routeTrail` keeps the original's failed/refused rows and ends on the
  understudy with `via: 'concierge'`. Returns `409 { error: 'locked' }` on a Locked chat and
  `409 { error: 'no-understudy' }` when nobody can take it. Never changes the chat's state. Off
  duty does not block it (it is the operator's request, not the Concierge's), and the configured
  desk is used even off duty (`resolveConfiguredConciergeDesk`). Profiles on the provider and
  model that answered the original are excluded too, so a profile reassigned since cannot hand
  the retry back to the same model (text and pictures alike).
- **Try uncensored, pictures.** New action `POST /api/v1/chats/[id]?action=retry-image-uncensored`.
  Body `{ toolMessageId }` re-runs a `generate_image` call's arguments on the uncensored image
  understudy and posts a new TOOL message 1 ms after the original (so it sits beside it) with the
  images and a trail via `'concierge'`; the Concierge posts `refusal-rerouted` when the original
  had a refused row. Body `{ kind: 'background' }` queues a story background with the new payload
  field `forceUncensored`, which paints on the understudy (candid prompt) and abandons quietly if
  the chat was Locked or the understudy vanished before the job ran. Same `409` codes.
- `regenerateMessageAsSwipe` accepts `profileOverride` and `routeTrail`; the swipe SSE transport
  moved to `streamSwipeRegeneration` (`lib/services/chat-message/regenerate-swipe-stream.ts`),
  shared by both routes. `ImageToolExecutionContext.primaryVia` labels a pre-chosen profile.
  Retry gate and lookups live in `lib/services/dangerous-content/retry-uncensored.ts`.
- Salon: a shield icon ("Try uncensored") on character lines' action bars, a "Try uncensored"
  button on `generate_image` tool blocks and on the Lantern's refused-backdrop bubble. All hidden
  on Locked chats. A 409 toasts the reason.
- **"Not Dangerous" clears the blur.** `MessageRow` blurs/collapses only while some flag is not
  overridden; overridden chips stay, struck through. The row's memo now notices the override.
- **The Lantern's refusals reach the chat.** When the painter refuses a story background and no
  understudy answers (none, Locked, off duty, or the understudy failed too), the job posts a
  Lantern bubble (`systemSender: 'lantern'`, `systemKind: 'background-refused'`, trail attached,
  not gated by the image-alert setting) and **completes** instead of failing. The Concierge's own
  `refusal-no-understudy` / `refusal-not-permitted` bubble is not posted for the Lantern (new
  chokepoint option `announceUnresolvedRefusal: false`).
- **No synthesised flags on Unmoderated chats.** The danger orchestrator no longer writes
  `dangerFlags` (or the "Rerouted" chip) on every user message of an Unmoderated chat; the route
  trail's `via: 'concierge'` carries the reroute. A new `routedDirect` flag on the orchestrator's
  result keeps such turns treated as dangerous by the empty-body recovery and fallback chain, as
  the flags used to. The spec's `resolvedDisplay` field on `GET /api/v1/chats/[id]` was not added:
  phase 4 already resolves the chat's display on the client (`resolveConciergeSettings(...).display`).
- The spec's `conciergeMeta` bubble field was not added (it would have needed a column): the
  Lantern bubble is recognised by its `systemKind`, and the picture retry lives on the TOOL block,
  which exists by the time the operator can press it (the Concierge's bubble is posted before it).

#### Changed: the Concierge's own Settings tab (Concierge overhaul, phase 4)

- New Settings tab **The Concierge** (`/settings?tab=concierge`) with five cards: On duty
  (`on-duty`), The uncensored desk (`uncensored-desk`), When a provider refuses (`refusals`),
  Display (`display`), and Pre-screening (`pre-screening`, collapsed). `/foundry/concierge` and the
  Foundry card point at it.
- New `chat_settings.conciergeSettings` (`ConciergeSettingsSchema`): `enabled`, the four desk
  profiles (`uncensoredTextProfileId`, `uncensoredImageProfileId`, `uncensoredVisionProfileId`,
  `imagePromptProfileId`), `autoSwitchAfterRefusals`, `newChatsStartAs`, `display { mode,
  showWarningBadges }`, `preScreen { enabled, threshold, three scans, customClassificationPrompt,
  summaryClassification }`. It replaces `dangerousContentSettings`, the top-level
  `uncensoredImageDescriptionProfileId`, and `cheapLLMSettings.imagePromptProfileId`, which are no
  longer read (columns kept; a later migration drops them).
- The global mode (`OFF` / `DETECT_ONLY` / `AUTO_ROUTE`) is retired. Migration
  `add-concierge-settings-v1`: `OFF` → off duty; `DETECT_ONLY` and `AUTO_ROUTE` → on duty with the
  pre-screen and summary classification on. **Behaviour change:** a `DETECT_ONLY` user now gets
  refusal failover. An `OFF` user with any Unmoderated chat is kept on duty (pre-screen off) so
  those chats keep the uncensored desk. The same translation runs on restore of a pre-4.10 backup.
- New installs: the Concierge is on duty with failover and no classifier. The per-message
  pre-screen, the summary classifier and the 10-minute sweep run only when opted in; the sweep
  does not start unless some user has `summaryClassification` on.
- `resolveConciergeSettings(global, chat)` replaces `resolveDangerousContentSettings` and returns a
  policy (`onDuty`, `failoverAllowed`, `routeDirect`, `preScreen`, `summaryClassification`,
  `autoSwitchAfterRefusals`, `desk`, `display`, `source`). Every `mode` check now asks the named
  question. Locked, exempt and off-duty chats get an empty desk, including the image-prompt crafter
  and the vision fallback.
- Off duty: no failover, no announcements, no auto-switch, no pre-screen; the per-chat Concierge
  select in the Salon sidebar and New Chat form is disabled with a pointer to the tab, and the
  Salon shows flagged content plainly.
- `newChatsStartAs` sets a new chat's state when the request names none (only while on duty); the
  New Chat form preselects it. Off duty, a requested non-Moderated state is ignored and the form's
  default reads Moderated.
- Refusal-time checks re-read the global on-duty switch as well as the chat's state
  (`readCurrentConciergeOnDuty`), so turning the Concierge off mid-call stops the failover.
- Unmoderated chats route Aurora avatars and Lantern backgrounds straight to the uncensored image
  profile before the call, like the `generate_image` tool.
- The uncensored vision fallback follows the chat's policy (not used in Locked or exempt chats);
  callers pass the `chatId`.
- The Salon's badge and blur settings come from the chat's resolved policy (no badges on an
  Unmoderated chat, plain display off duty).
- `PUT /api/v1/settings/chat` validates `conciergeSettings` and returns `400` for
  `dangerousContentSettings`, `uncensoredImageDescriptionProfileId` or
  `cheapLLMSettings.imagePromptProfileId`.
- `help_settings` gains a `concierge` category; `chat` no longer returns Concierge settings.
- Removed from the Chat tab: the Dangerous Content card, the uncensored vision fallback in Image
  Description, and the Image Prompt Expansion LLM picker (all now on the desk card).
- Help: `help/dangerous-content.md` renamed `help/the-concierge.md` and rewritten; every link
  repointed; `help/settings.md` now lists eight tabs.
- Phase 3 carry-overs: migration `drop-chat-concierge-override-v1` drops `chats.conciergeOverride`
  and the field leaves `ChatMetadataSchema`; `.qtap` import and backup restore still derive
  `conciergeMode` from it (tested), and the export schema keeps it as deprecated.
- Phase 3 carry-over: the unused `-info` Concierge tone is removed (`.qt-danger-badge-info`,
  `.qt-concierge-mark-info`, the `'info'` member of `ConciergeTone`), mirrored in
  `@quilltap/theme-storybook` 1.0.73. No bundled theme or theme template hooked either class.

#### Fixed: Concierge state races (PR #75 review)

- `conciergeMode` / `conciergeModeSetBy` / `conciergeModeReason` are patch-only on `chats`: a
  whole-row `update` that does not name them leaves them out of its `$set`, so a concurrent title
  or telemetry write can no longer rewind a newer state. New `patchOnlyFields()` hook on
  `AbstractBaseRepository`.
- New `ChatsRepository.setConciergeMode(chatId, columns, expected?)`, the only writer of the state.
  With `expected` it is a compare-and-set (NULL counts as moderated). `applyConciergeFlip` uses it
  for every transition; the Concierge's own moves pass the state he read and announce nothing on a
  miss, and are refused in the job child.
- The classifier job no longer flips the chat. It records telemetry with
  `chats.setDangerClassification` (verdict carried, not stored); the job dispatcher's new commit
  hook calls `maybeSwitchAfterClassification` in the parent, which moves the chat only if it is
  still Moderated.
- The image failover chokepoint and both text failover paths re-read the chat's state when a
  refusal arrives (`readCurrentConciergeState`), so a chat locked mid-request is never rerouted.
- `POST /api/v1/chats` now returns the Concierge columns as they stand after the requested state
  is applied; it used to return the row as first inserted, so a chat created Unmoderated or
  Locked came back looking Moderated.

#### Docs: phase 3 leftovers scheduled in phase 4

- `concierge-overhaul-phase-4-concierge-tab.md` gains a "Carried over from phase 3" checklist:
  drop `chats.conciergeOverride` (keeping the legacy derivation in import and restore, and the
  deprecated export-schema field), and remove the unused `-info` Concierge tone CSS (with its
  theme-storybook mirror and publish). Phase 3 spec and the overview index point to it.

#### Changed: three Concierge states — Moderated, Unmoderated, Locked (Concierge overhaul, phase 3)

- The four per-chat states (Monitored, Flagged, Vouched Safe, Uncensored) are now three:
  **Moderated** (default; ordinary providers first, uncensored on refusal; the Concierge may switch
  the chat), **Unmoderated** (uncensored desk only) and **Locked** (ordinary providers only; a
  refusal stands). Who set Unmoderated (operator or Concierge) is provenance, shown in the tooltip
  and helper text, not a separate state or colour.
- Three new columns on `chats`: `conciergeMode` (TEXT, default 'moderated'; NULL reads as
  moderated), `conciergeModeSetBy` ('operator' | 'concierge'), `conciergeModeReason` ('manual' |
  'refusals' | 'classifier' | 'migration'). Migration `add-chat-concierge-mode-v1` backfills them:

  | `conciergeOverride` | `isDangerousChat` | new state | set by | reason |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `'UNCENSORED'` | any | unmoderated | operator | migration |
  | `'OFF'` | any | locked | operator | migration |
  | NULL | true | unmoderated | concierge | classifier |
  | NULL | else | moderated | NULL | NULL |

- `conciergeOverride` is no longer written (kept, marked deprecated in the export schema).
  `isDangerousChat` and the other `danger*` fields are classifier telemetry only; no routing or
  display decision reads them. `.qtap` import and backup restore derive `conciergeMode` from the
  legacy pair when a chat carries none (`withConciergeModeFromLegacy`).
- `chat-override.ts`: `ConciergeState` is the three values; new `getConciergeProvenance`,
  `getConciergeReason`, `mayFailOver` / `conciergeStateMayFailOver` (false only for Locked),
  `CONCIERGE_STATES`, `deriveConciergeModeFromLegacy`. `isClassifierOnDuty` now means Moderated.
- Resolver sources: `chat-locked` and `chat-unmoderated` replace `chat-vouched` and
  `chat-uncensored`. `VOUCHED_SAFE_DANGEROUS_CONTENT_SETTINGS` renamed
  `LOCKED_DANGEROUS_CONTENT_SETTINGS`.
- `applyConciergeFlip` writes only the three new columns (Moderated also clears the classifier
  telemetry and the refusal ledger). Announcement kinds `set-moderated`, `set-unmoderated`,
  `set-locked`, `auto-unmoderated` replace `manual-flagged`, `manual-safe`, `manual-resumed`,
  `manual-vouched`, `manual-uncensored`, `auto-flagged-refusals`. An operator choosing Unmoderated
  on a chat the Concierge moved there updates provenance silently. The Concierge may only move a
  Moderated chat to Unmoderated.
- The classifier job and the refusal-ledger auto-switch both move the chat through
  `applyConciergeFlip(..., 'unmoderated', ..., { by: 'concierge', reason })`. The auto-switch no
  longer stamps `dangerCategories: ['moderation-refusals']`.
- Failover: the image chokepoint and the text empty-response / hard-error failover check
  `mayFailOver` before the mode. A stated refusal on a Locked chat posts `refusal-not-permitted`
  with `reason: 'locked'` and is never rerouted to an uncensored profile. The creation greeting's
  content-filter fallback never runs for Locked.
- Wire: `conciergeState` on `PUT /api/v1/chats/[id]` and `POST /api/v1/chats` is
  `'moderated' | 'unmoderated' | 'locked'`; the old four values return 400. GET returns
  `conciergeState`, `conciergeSetBy`, `conciergeReason`, `conciergeRefusalCount`, and no longer
  `conciergeOverride`. List payloads add `conciergeSetBy` and `conciergeReason`.
- UI: flat three-option selects on the New Chat form and the sidebar; header pill and list mark
  are red for Unmoderated, grey for Locked (`shield` icon), nothing for Moderated. Quick-hide's
  "Dangerous Chats" hides Unmoderated chats. The `-info` badge/mark CSS variants have no user now;
  left in place for themes.
- `scripts/concierge-four-state-test.sh` renamed `scripts/concierge-three-state-test.sh` and
  rewritten for the three states (adds a check that a retired value is rejected).
- Docs: `help/dangerous-content.md`, `chats.md`, `quick-hide.md`, `homepage.md`,
  `autonomous-rooms.md`, `story-backgrounds.md`, `scene-state-tracker.md`,
  `image-generation-profiles.md`; DDL, API, export schema, CLAUDE.md; the four-state, list-marks
  and default-at-creation specs are marked superseded.

#### Added: the Concierge's refusal ledger and auto-switch (Concierge overhaul, phase 2)

- Two columns on `chats`: `moderationRefusalCount` (INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0) and
  `lastModerationRefusalAt` (TEXT). Migration `add-chat-refusal-ledger-v1`. Both are kept out of
  `ChatMetadataSchema` (same reason as `transcriptVersion`: a whole-row `update` could rewind the
  counter), so they are not in `.qtap` exports. New `ChatsRepository` methods:
  `incrementModerationRefusalCount` (atomic `+ 1`), `getModerationRefusalLedger`,
  `resetModerationRefusalLedger`.
- `recordModerationRefusal` (`lib/services/dangerous-content/refusal-ledger.ts`) is the only
  writer. Called by `generateImageWithConciergeFailover` (primary refused, whatever the reroute's
  outcome; nothing without a chat), by the text empty-response recovery and hard-error failover,
  and by the cheap-LLM path when an empty body carries a moderation finish reason. Only
  `typed-error`, `provider-code`, `finish-reason` and `message-pattern` evidence counts;
  `inferred` never does.
- Auto-switch: once the count reaches `autoSwitchAfterRefusals` on a Monitored chat under
  Auto-Route, the Concierge switches it to Flagged via
  `applyConciergeFlip(chatId, 'flagged', chat, { by: 'concierge', reason: 'refusals' })`, which
  stamps `dangerCategories: ['moderation-refusals']` and posts the new `auto-flagged-refusals`
  announcement (count and last refusing provider). Never on Flagged, Vouched Safe, Uncensored,
  moderation-exempt chats, or under Detect Only / Off. Runs in the parent only: after an in-parent
  increment, or from a new commit hook in `applyWritesUnsafe` for increments buffered by the job
  child. Concurrent checks for one chat are serialized so the switch is announced once.
- New setting `dangerousContentSettings.autoSwitchAfterRefusals` (0-10, default 2, 0 = never),
  shown as a number field on the Dangerous Content card. Vouched Safe settings carry 0.
- `applyConciergeFlip` gains an optional `{ by, reason, refusals }` argument (default: the
  operator; existing transitions unchanged). Its `'monitored'` case now also resets the ledger.
- Review fixes: the auto-switch re-reads the chat right before flipping and abandons the switch if
  it left Monitored during the check, so it cannot overwrite an operator's newer choice; a
  threshold of 1 no longer announces "More than once now"; a moderation stop stated by the
  same-provider retry after a plain empty opening is now recorded (once per turn).
- Phase-1 review carry-overs: the `refusal-rerouted` bubble no longer says the picture is
  "attached above" (the note posts before the picture); `scripts/concierge-four-state-test.sh`
  wraps `content` in `qt_text()` in `check_ann` and CT-4.

#### Docs: phase 2 spec carries two deferred phase-1 review fixes

- `concierge-overhaul-phase-2-refusal-ledger.md` gains a "Carried over from phase 1 review"
  checklist: reword the `refusal-rerouted` bubble so it no longer says the picture is "attached
  above", and decode `chat_messages.content` with `qt_text()` in `check_ann` and CT-4 of
  `scripts/concierge-four-state-test.sh`.

#### Changed: the Concierge reroutes every content refusal (Concierge overhaul, phase 1)

- One refusal classifier: `classifyRefusal` (`lib/services/dangerous-content/refusal.ts`).
  Evidence in order of trust: a typed plugin error (`code: 'MODERATION_REJECTED'`), a known
  provider code (`moderation_blocked`, `content_policy_violation`, `content_filter`, `safety`,
  Z.AI `1301`), a moderation finish reason, refusal wording in the error text (the old six image
  substrings plus "responsible ai", "declined to generate", "blocked by safety", "prompt_blocked",
  "image_safety"), and an empty body on content the Concierge had flagged. A bare 400, a rate
  limit or an auth failure is never a refusal. `classifyEmptyBody` and `classifyFallbackTrigger`
  delegate to it; `isImageModerationError` is removed.
- One understudy resolver: `resolveUncensoredTextUnderstudy` / `resolveUncensoredImageUnderstudy`
  (`understudy.ts`). The configured uncensored profile, then any profile ticked
  "Uncensored-compatible", then nobody; courier profiles are skipped; the mode is never read.
  Pre-flight and post-hoc now agree, so an image profile only needs the tick to be a candidate.
  `resolveUncensoredImageProfileForReroute` is removed; the pre-flight
  `resolve*ProviderForDangerousContent` functions are thin wrappers that keep the Auto-Route gate.
- One image failover chokepoint: `generateImageWithConciergeFailover` (`image-failover.ts`), used
  by the `generate_image` tool, the Lantern's story backgrounds, Aurora's avatar job and the
  legacy image dialog (`POST /api/v1/images?action=generate`, which now also resolves Concierge
  settings with the chat). It retries a refusal once on the understudy under Auto-Route, rethrows
  anything that is not a refusal untouched, and attaches the route trail to a rethrown error.
- The Lantern: the bug-133 gate that barred a reroute on a Monitored chat is removed; the prompt is
  still never re-crafted on reroute. `uncensoredImageTarget` now also requires Auto-Route, so a
  Flagged chat under Detect Only no longer gets a candid prompt sent to a moderated provider.
- Text turns: a thrown content-policy error was classified as "not a fallback trigger" and nothing
  happened. It is now `moderation-refusal`: recorded on the route trail as refused, retried on the
  uncensored understudy under Auto-Route (new `attemptUncensoredRetry`, shared with the empty-body
  path, which no longer requires an explicit `uncensoredTextProfileId`), then the profile's own
  chain with `dangerous: true`. Cheap-LLM fallback chains also walk on a refusal now.
- Route trails on image-bearing messages: `RouteAttempt` gains `profileKind: 'connection' | 'image'`
  (absent = connection) and `evidence` gains `typed-error`, `provider-code`, `message-pattern`.
  The TOOL message of a `generate_image` call and the Lantern / Aurora bubble carry the trail;
  `ToolMessage` renders it; image rows are labelled by profile name. The tool result now names
  the model that actually answered, not the one first asked.
- The Concierge speaks: `postConciergeRefusalAnnouncement` posts `systemKind: 'refusal'` bubbles —
  `refusal-rerouted`, `refusal-no-understudy`, `refusal-not-permitted` — for every image refusal,
  and `refusal-no-understudy` for a text refusal with nobody to ask. Chip label "provider refusal".
- `extractFinishReason` also reads Google's `promptFeedback.blockReason` and OpenRouter's camelCase
  `finishReason`.
- `@quilltap/plugin-types` 2.8.0: `ModerationRejectionError` (`code: 'MODERATION_REJECTED'`,
  `providerReason`). Published; the root dependency is now `^2.8.0` and the five plugins below
  are rebuilt against it.
- Plugins (all require plugin-types `^2.8.0`):
  - `qtap-plugin-openai` 1.0.65: image `moderation_blocked` / `content_policy_violation` /
    "safety system" → typed; streamed and non-streamed raw responses carry the real finish reason
    (`incomplete_details.reason`, `refusal`); `response.incomplete` ends the stream.
  - `qtap-plugin-grok` 1.0.57: image "content moderation" → typed; same finish-reason fix.
  - `qtap-plugin-google` 1.1.54: Gemini `IMAGE_SAFETY` / `SAFETY` / `PROHIBITED_CONTENT` or
    `promptFeedback.blockReason`, Imagen filtered predictions, and Responsible-AI HTTP errors →
    typed; a blocked text prompt reports its block reason as the finish reason on both paths.
  - `qtap-plugin-openrouter` 1.0.65: image `refusal` / text-instead-of-image and refusal-worded HTTP
    errors → typed; streamed raw responses write `finish_reason` (snake_case) with the real reason.
  - `qtap-plugin-z-ai` 1.1.30: image code `1301` → typed.
  - NanoGPT unchanged: its filtered-prompt 400 is generic and is not treated as a refusal.

#### Docs: Concierge overhaul specs

- Added `docs/developer/features/concierge-overhaul.md` and five self-contained phase specs
  (refusal-driven failover at every call site, a per-chat refusal ledger with auto-switch, three
  chat states Moderated / Unmoderated / Locked, the Concierge's own Settings tab with the global
  mode retired, and Salon polish including "Try uncensored"). Proposal only; no code change.

#### Fixed: switching the Salon's "speaking as" seat raised "Unknown action" (bug 170)

- `useImpersonation.handleSetActiveSpeaker` sent `?action=set-active-speaker` as PUT; the chat
  route serves it on POST only. Before the single `?action=` dispatcher the PUT fell through to a
  no-op chat update, so the switch showed in the composer but never persisted server-side. After
  it, the request was a 400. It now sends POST. Regression test added.

#### Fixed: narrow-pane chat sidebar closed the Scenario Builder on first click (bug 169)

- When the Salon pane is narrower than 640 px the chat sidebar is an overlay that collapses on
  any click outside it. `BaseModal` portals to `<body>`, so clicks inside **Ask the Host to set
  the scene** and **Save as scenario…** counted as outside; the sidebar collapsed, unmounted
  `ChatScenarioControl`, closed the dialog, and aborted any running build.
- New `shouldDismissSidebarOverlay` (`components/chat/sidebar-overlay-dismiss.ts`) ignores
  targets inside a `.qt-dialog-overlay`. Escape still collapses the sidebar, as before.

#### Changed: one base class for the mount-index and LLM-logs repositories

- New `AbstractDedicatedDbRepository` (`lib/database/repositories/dedicated-db.repository.ts`)
  replaces the ten private copies of `getCollection()` in the nine mount-index repositories and
  `llm-logs.repository.ts`. It takes the connection guard in its constructor, runs the generated
  DDL once per instance, runs an `onTableEnsured(db)` hook for extra indexes / inline
  `ALTER TABLE` migrations / repair scans, runs `afterTableReady(db)` once the table counts as
  ensured (the folder backfill, which re-enters the repository), caches the column
  classification once instead of recomputing it on every call, and builds the collection.
- New `withRawDb(fallback, fn, errorMessage, context, mode?)` replaces the 26 hand-rolled
  `const db = getRawMountIndexDatabase(); if (!db) return …` preambles in the chunks, documents,
  files and file-links repositories. Every raw-SQL site now applies the same degraded /
  uninitialized guard and ensures the table first; previously most skipped one or both.
  `ensureRawDb()` covers the writers that must throw instead.
- New `requireLLMLogsDb()` (`lib/database/backends/sqlite/llm-logs-guard.ts`), the LLM-logs
  twin of `requireMountIndexDb()`.
- The base takes a `blobColumns` option, and `DocMountChunksRepository` passes `['embedding']`
  as before, so a chunk's `Float32Array` embedding is still written as a Float32 BLOB. A new
  test round-trips an embedding through the real repository on in-memory SQLite.
- Every repository now declares `dbTarget` (`'main' | 'mountIndex' | 'llmLogs'`), and a new unit
  test checks the background-job write partitioner's `MOUNT_INDEX_REPO_KEYS` /
  `LLM_LOGS_REPO_KEYS` against those declarations, so the `groupDocMountLinks` /
  `groupCharacterMembers` omission fixed below cannot recur.
- No DDL changes.

#### Changed: `GET /api/v1/chats/[id]` dispatches `?action=` through `dispatchAction`

- The handler's hand-written `if (action === '…')` ladder is gone. Every GET action
  (`export`, `export-markdown`, `get-avatars`, `get-state`, `outfit`, `outfit-summary`,
  `photo-albums`, `informs`, `group-stores`, `mailbox`, `accessible-stores`, `get-background`,
  `gallery`, `cost`) is a registered key; an unknown or empty `?action=` now returns 400 with
  `availableActions` instead of falling through to the chat body. No action's response changed.
- This is the follow-up the "one `?action=` dispatcher" entry below left open; the handler
  now calls the same `dispatchAction` primitive as every other route.
- `get-background` moved to `handleGetStoryBackground` in
  `app/api/v1/chats/[id]/actions/story-background.ts`, beside `regenerate-background`.

#### Changed: one `?action=` dispatcher for every API route

- New `dispatchAction(req, thunks, fallback?)` in `lib/api/middleware/actions.ts`, and
  `withActionDispatch` is now built on it. The rule is in one place: no `action` parameter
  runs the fallback (the plain CRUD verb), a known action runs its handler, and anything
  else — an unknown name or a bare `?action=` — is a 400 listing the available actions.
- Every route that read `?action=` by hand (`getActionParam` + `isValidAction` + a
  `Record<Action, () => …>` map, or an `if (action === …)` chain) now calls the primitive:
  api-keys, brahma-console, characters, chats (collection, item POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, files),
  connection-profiles, embedding-profiles, files, groups, help-chats, help-docs, images,
  image-profiles, memories, messages, mount-points, plugins, projects, scenarios (general,
  project and group tiers), settings/text-replacements, system/conversation-summaries,
  system/jobs, system/restore, system/tools, system/unlock, themes and user/profile. The
  per-route `*_ACTIONS` constants and hand-built "Unknown action" messages are gone.
- **Fixed as a result:** an unknown action no longer falls through to a destructive
  default. `DELETE /api/v1/projects/[id]?action=<anything unknown>` used to delete the
  project, `DELETE /api/v1/groups/[id]?action=<unknown>` deleted the group, and an unknown
  `POST /api/v1/system/restore?action=` ran a full restore. Unknown actions on
  `POST /api/v1/api-keys`, `/characters`, `/connection-profiles`, `/image-profiles`,
  `/memories`, `/images`, `/mount-points`, `/settings/text-replacements` and
  `/chats/[id]/files` also no longer create or upload by accident. The project and group
  route headers had advertised `get-mount-point` / `set-mount-point` / `clear-mount-point`
  and `stores` / `linkStore` / `unlinkStore` actions that never existed; those lines are
  removed (group stores live under `/api/v1/groups/[id]/mount-points`).
- `GET /api/v1/chats/[id]` was left reading its actions inline here; the entry above
  converts it.
- `withActionDispatch` now treats a bare `?action=` as an unknown action (400) instead of
  routing it to the default handler.
- `POST /api/v1/chats/[id]/files` responses go through `successResponse` and one shared
  payload builder; `handleLinkFile` takes the real `RepositoryContainer` type.
- Tests: `dispatchAction` unit coverage, and regression tests for the project, group and
  restore fall-throughs.

#### Removed: dead code in `lib/database`

- 33 repository methods with no callers (for example `CharactersRepository.getSystemPrompts`,
  `MemoriesRepository.findByKeywords`, `UsersRepository.findByUsername`,
  `FoldersRepository.createMany`, `EmbeddingStatusRepository.upsertByEntity`) and their
  private helpers; unused backend/infra exports (`SQLiteBackend.addJsonColumn` /
  `dropCollection` / prepared-statement cache, `json-columns.ts` `hydrateRow` /
  `rowToDocument` / `detectJsonColumns` / `fromJson` / `jsonArrayLength`, manager
  `healthCheck` / `listCollections` / `getBackendCapabilities` / `isDatabaseInitialized` /
  `isDatabaseConnected` / `_setBackendForTesting`, child-client close/connected helpers) and
  their barrel re-exports. About 980 lines. `jest.setup.ts` drops the matching stale mock keys.
- `escapeLikePattern` (`fts-query.ts`) was a byte-identical copy of `escapeLikeLiteral`
  (`like-escape.ts`); the copy is gone and both callers use the shared one.

#### Fixed: data-layer consistency

- `MOUNT_INDEX_REPO_KEYS` (`lib/background-jobs/host/write-partition.ts`) was missing
  `groupDocMountLinks` and `groupCharacterMembers`, both backed by the mount-index database.
  A buffered child write to either would have been committed inside the main database's
  transaction. Added.
- `MemoriesRepository` and `ConversationChunksRepository` cached "blob columns registered"
  per instance, the pattern `HelpDocsRepository` documents as corrupting embeddings after a
  backend reconnect. Both now re-assert the registration on every `getCollection()` (a no-op
  when already registered), matching the help-doc repositories.
- `DocMountBlobsRepository` used an inline copy of the mount-index degraded/uninitialized
  guard; it now calls the shared `requireMountIndexDb()`.
- Brahma's SQL prompt now tells the model that `chat_messages.content` (and the other
  compressed text columns) must be read through `qt_text()` and never compared bare.

#### Fixed: help docs failed to index

- Bug 167: `EMBEDDING_REINDEX_ALL` synced help docs in the job child, where `upsertByPath`
  returned a random synthetic id. Section chunks were keyed to that id, failed the
  `help_doc_chunks` foreign key on replay, and rolled back the job's entire main-DB batch
  (including every embedding job it queued). The job then went DEAD. `syncHelpDocs` now uses the
  existing row's id or mints one and passes it to `create(fields, { id })`. `upsertByPath` is
  removed.
- Bug 168: the `HELP_DOC` job embedded each page in one call, so pages over the provider's input
  limit (`chat-settings.md` over OpenAI's 8,192 tokens) failed and dropped out of `help_search`.
  A doc's vector is now the normalised mean of its section vectors (`averageEmbeddings` in
  `lib/embedding/embedding-service.ts`). A failed section is skipped; the job fails only if every
  section fails. A doc with no chunk rows yet is sliced in memory.
- New test `__tests__/unit/lib/help/help-doc-size.test.ts` counts `cl100k_base` tokens (new
  devDependency `js-tiktoken`) of every help section's embedding text and fails above
  `HELP_SECTION_EMBEDDING_MAX_TOKENS` (1,000).
- `help/chat-settings.md` split into `chat-settings.md`, `chat-settings-composer.md` and
  `chat-settings-ai-services.md`. Links in other help files and the help Guide categories
  updated.
- Help docs are reconciled at every startup (`reconcileHelpDocs`, instrumentation Phase 3.66),
  not only when the set of help file names changes: every file is compared by content hash,
  edited pages are rewritten and re-sliced, pages with no sections are sliced (per page, not
  "any rows at all"), and a `HELP_DOC` job is queued for every page missing its own vector or
  any section vector. `ensureHelpDocsSynced` now waits on the same once-per-process run.
  `backfillHelpDocChunks`, `helpDocsDivergeFromDisk` and
  `HelpDocsRepository.findAllNeedingEmbedding` removed; `HelpDocChunksRepository.countByDoc`
  added. Only help docs are re-embedded; affected instances recover on the next restart.
- A content change now also clears the doc's `embedding_status` row, so a stale FAILED status
  no longer keeps it out of a mismatched-dim reindex.

#### Removed: `GET /api/v1/chats?action=has-dangerous`

- The action had no callers after the `useHasDangerousChats` hook was removed. `GET
  /api/v1/chats` now only lists chats and returns 400 for any `?action=`.

#### Added: `@` character typeahead in the Salon composer

- Typing `@` at the start of a word opens a menu of characters (chat cast first, then all
  non-archived characters from `/api/v1/characters`), filtered by name or word prefix.
- Enter, Tab or click completes the highlighted name; Space completes it when at least one
  query character was typed and keeps the space. A bare `@` plus Space is left alone.
- The completed text is the plain name with the `@` removed, except at the start of a line
  (top-level paragraph, or after a soft line break): there the `@` is kept only if the name is
  followed by `:` or `?` and whitespace (a Carina / Brahma query); anything else removes it in
  an update merged into the same undo step. Names the Carina parser cannot address (hyphen,
  apostrophe, non-ASCII, single character) drop the `@` immediately; the parser's name grammar
  is now exported as `isCarinaInvocableName` (`lib/chat/carina-parser.ts`) and shared.
- At the start of a line the menu also offers Brahma (`BRAHMA_MENTION`), unless a character
  named Brahma already exists.
- While the character list is loading the menu shows a loading label (an error label if the
  fetch fails) instead of "no match", and holds Enter/Tab so a half-typed `@name` is not sent.
- An undo or redo that restores a line-start `@Name` to its undecided form re-arms the
  keep-or-strip check.
- New `MentionTypeaheadPlugin` and pure logic in `lib/mentions/mention-typeahead.ts`.
  `$textBeforeCursor` / `$isGluedToPreviousRun` moved from `CharTypeaheadPlugin` into
  `components/chat/lexical/typeahead/trigger-context.ts` so both typeaheads share them.

#### Fixed: `update_version.sh` put the branch name in the version

- Any branch other than `main`, `release` or `bugfix` got its branch name as the prerelease
  channel (e.g. `4.10.0-claude-some-branch.50`), which also landed in the README badge.
  Every non-`release`/non-`bugfix` branch now uses the `dev` channel. `bugfix` and
  `bugfix/*` use `bugfix`; `release` and `release/*` still get no channel.

#### Added: quick-hide toggle for Salon images

- New **Salon Images** toggle in the quick-hide menu's Content Filters. When on, the Salon
  hides the story background (and the workspace backdrop it reports), avatars in messages,
  the participant sidebar, the speaking-as portrait and the header breadcrumb, attached and
  tool-result image thumbnails, and images embedded in message markdown. Off by default;
  persisted in localStorage (`quilltap.quickHide.hideSalonImages`) like the other toggles.
- The Salon passes the flag down through a new `ImagesHiddenProvider`
  (`components/quick-hide/images-hidden-context.tsx`); `Avatar`, `MessageContent`,
  `ToolMessage`, `SpeakingAsAvatar` and `MessageRow` read it. Other pages are unaffected.
- Also covered: server pre-rendered message HTML that contains an `<img>` (`LazyMessageContent`
  takes the full `MessageContent` render while hidden), the Host icon on the scenario
  control, and avatars in the Insert Announcement, Inform and Impersonation Voice dialogs.
  Galleries, the file picker, the image viewer and the app-level wardrobe dialog still show
  images.
- The sidebar footer's quick-hide button is now always shown; the `useHasDangerousChats`
  hook that gated it is removed.

#### Fixed: creating a character scenario returned an id that was never stored (bug 165)

- `CharactersRepository.addScenario` returned the id it minted, but a vault-backed character
  re-keys scenarios from their file path on read, so `POST /api/v1/characters/[id]/scenarios`
  returned an id nothing else would ever see. It now re-reads and returns the projected entry.

#### Fixed: the workspace New Chat dialog never offered group scenarios (bug 166)

- `NewChatModal` did not pass `groupScenarios` to `NewChatForm`; the `/salon/new` page did.

#### Added: Scenario Builder — the Host researches and drafts a starting scene

- New **Ask the Host to set the scene** button beside the scenario text on the New Chat form
  (page and workspace dialog) and in the Salon sidebar's Scenario control. The dialog takes
  mode (real / in-world), location, time and optional details, plus a connection profile
  (the default is preselected; profiles with tool use off are listed but disabled).
- `POST /api/v1/scenario-builder?action=build` runs an ephemeral tool loop in the parent
  process and streams tool events, reasoning and a terminal `done` carrying the scene over SSE.
  Closing the request aborts the loop. `GET ?action=capabilities` reports whether web search and
  curl are configured. Nothing is persisted except LLM log rows, now typed `SCENARIO_BUILDER`.
- Tool slate: `search` (documents and knowledge only — new builder variant), the five read-only
  `doc_*` tools, and `submit_final_response`; real mode adds `search_web` (when the profile
  allows it and a provider is configured) and `curl`. In-world mode never gets the web.
- Tools are scoped to what the chat could see: the cast's vaults, the union of their groups'
  stores, the project's stores and Quilltap General, via a new `mountPool` on the tool, search
  and doc-edit contexts (`resolveScenarioBuilderMountPool`). `mountPool` and `operatorSurface`
  are mutually exclusive. `doc_grep` / `doc_list_files` accept a `mountPool` in place of a
  project.
- The prompt requires a cast-agnostic scene (no names, no placeholders, present tense) of about
  1,000 tokens or fewer. The review pane is an editable draft with Revise, **Use this scene**
  (fills the custom text; in-chat, **Change scenario** still persists it and the Host announces
  the revision) and **Save as scenario…** to General, the project, a cast member's group, or a
  cast character's own scenarios; the picker then selects the saved preset when its re-read
  tier lists it (`useNewChat().refetchScenarioTiers` returns the fresh tiers for that check).
- Refactors: the Brahma one-shot loop moved to `runOneShotToolLoop`
  (`lib/services/agent-loop/one-shot-loop.ts`), shared by `runBrahmaQuery` and the builder.
  `buildTools` takes `docToolsMode: 'off' | 'read' | 'full'` in place of the document-editing
  boolean and an extras argument (`pluginToolAllowlist`, `documentsOnlySearch`, `webSearch`);
  `streamMessage` takes an optional `logType`. The Brahma Console's SSE parsing moved to
  `components/agent-stream/parse-agent-stream.ts`, shared with the builder's hook.
- `GET /api/v1/groups` accepts `?characterIds=` to list only those characters' groups.
- `useConnectionProfiles` now maps `isDefault`, `allowToolUse` and `allowWebSearch`.
- Help: new `help/scenario-builder.md`; pointers from chats, general scenarios and project
  scenarios.

#### Docs: plan for the Scenario Builder

- Added `docs/developer/features/scenario-builder.md`, the handoff spec for a Host-run scenario
  builder beside the custom scenario text on the New Chat form and the in-chat Change scenario
  control: four inputs (real or in-world, location, time, details), a connection-profile
  dropdown, an ephemeral tool loop generalised from the Brahma Console's one-shot service, web
  research for a real place and store-only research for an in-world one, a cast-agnostic draft
  of at most about 1,000 tokens with edit and revise, and saving to General, project, group or a
  character's scenarios. Roadmap and documentation index updated.

#### Fixed: story backgrounds follow every automatic retitle, and a hand-set title stays put (bugs 163, 164)

- A story background was queued only when the checkpoint title check renamed a chat. The
  context-summary fold also writes a new title after every pass, and so does ticking **Use automatic naming** in the rename dialog (the `regenerate-title` action),
  but neither queued a background. Past turn 10, when most renames come from the fold, the
  backdrop stayed on the first scene.
- The fold also ignored `isManuallyRenamed` and overwrote a title the user had set by hand at
  every fold. Named autonomous rooms were exposed the same way.
- All three titlers now go through `applyAutoTitle` (`lib/chat/auto-title.ts`). It re-reads the
  chat, keeps a hand-set title (only that checkbox overrules one), writes a title only
  when it changed, and queues the story background when it does. `queueStoryBackgroundIfEnabled`
  moved there from the `TITLE_UPDATE` handler.
- The fold skips its title call entirely on a hand-renamed chat.

#### Fixed: `quilltap db` raw SQL and `--repl` can read compressed columns again (bug 162)

- The low-level `db` path — raw SQL, `--repl`, `--tables`, `--count` — opened its own database
  connection instead of going through `openEncryptedDb`, so it never registered `qt_text()`.
  `SELECT qt_text(content) FROM chat_messages` answered `no such function: qt_text`, and every
  `--write` against `chat_messages` failed the same way, because the search-index triggers call
  that function on the new row. The subcommands (`messages`, `log`, `logs`) were never affected.
- That path now opens through `openEncryptedDb` like everything else the CLI opens. One opener, so
  the next function registered there reaches the REPL too.
- `packages/quilltap/README.md` notes under **Low-level options** that compressed text columns are
  BLOBs and need `qt_text()` to read as text.

#### Fixed: the running summary no longer invents a name for a character (bug 161)

The context summary is built by folding batches of turns into a running five-section record. The
transcript handed to that fold was labelled `USER:` and `ASSISTANT:`, while the prompt above it said
to use character names. On a chat where nobody happens to say a character's name out loud — a
two-seat chat between a character and your persona is the usual case, since the character addresses
you by name and nobody addresses the character — the model was asked to name a speaker it had no
name for, and supplied one. Every later fold then carried the invention forward, and read the
character's real name as an alias when it finally appeared.

- Transcript lines handed to the fold now carry a speaker name, resolved from the chat's seats.
  Removed and silent seats resolve too, so a message from a character who has since left the chat
  still gets their name.
- The resolver is shared with the fold-time episode pass, which had a private copy of it and was
  already getting this right. There is now one implementation instead of two.
- A seat that cannot be resolved — a broken character vault, an unattributed message — gets `User`
  or `Character`, and the prompt now says to keep such a label rather than invent a name for it.
- **New: Rebuild Summary…** in the Chat Sidebar's Organize drawer, for a summary that is already
  wrong. It discards the summary and lets the normal fold cadence rebuild it from the first turn,
  a few turns at a time. The chat has no summary until that catches up; the transcript is never
  touched. An autonomous room that is running refuses the request — pause it first.

Existing summaries are not rewritten. A wrong name cannot be told apart mechanically from a correct
one, so rebuilding is applied where you see the symptom rather than everywhere.

#### Docs: plan to fix the summarizer inventing names, and two bugs filed

- `docs/developer/features/context-summary-speaker-names.md` is the plan for bug 161. The
  context-summary fold currently renders its transcript as `USER:` / `ASSISTANT:` while its prompt
  says to use character names, so a character who is never named in the first ten turns gets a
  name invented for them, and every later fold carries it forward. The plan shares the episode
  pass's seat-to-name resolver with the fold, labels transcript lines by name, tells the prompt to
  keep a role label rather than invent, and adds a `rebuild-summary` chat action and Salon menu
  entry for summaries already poisoned. No migration: a wrong name is not mechanically detectable.
- Bug 161 (open): the running summary of a `Friday` chat calls one of its two characters
  "Vivienne", a name that appears in no message and belongs to no character.
- Bug 162 (open): the CLI's raw-SQL, `--repl` and `--write` path opens its own connection without
  `qt_text()`, so it cannot read a compressed column and every `--write` on `chat_messages` fails,
  because the search-index triggers call that function. The subcommands are unaffected.

#### Changed: message search is an index probe, and conversation text takes about a third less disk

Two changes that only work together. Global message search used to be a `LIKE '%...%'` scan of every
message in the instance — 355 MB read per query, about 55 ms — and that scan was the one thing
keeping the largest text in the database from being stored compressed. Replacing it with an FTS5
index makes the usual search a fraction of a millisecond and unblocks the compression. (A word that
appears in most of your messages still costs tens of milliseconds, because every match has to be
collected and sorted by date before the 100-result cap applies. The old path was worse there: it
applied that cap in JavaScript after loading every matching message.)

- **Search is indexed.** `create-chat-message-fts-v1` builds a contentless FTS5 index over the same
  rows search always covered: your messages and your characters', not system events or Staff
  announcements. The index is maintained by database triggers, so no write path can bypass it, and a
  startup check rebuilds it if a future schema change ever drops those triggers.
- **Queries with punctuation now work.** The old path escaped the query as a regular expression, then
  translated it to `LIKE` without an escape clause, so a period became a wildcard: searching
  `Mr. Smith` silently returned nothing. It now returns what you asked for.
- **Search matches whole words and word beginnings** rather than any run of letters. `walk` still
  finds *walking* and *walked*; it no longer finds *sidewalk*. Accents fold (`café` and `cafe` find
  each other) and case folding now covers non-ASCII letters. A query that is only punctuation or
  single letters, such as `C++`, falls back to the old exact scan. Results are still capped at 100
  and still ordered newest first, not by relevance.
- **Conversation text is compressed.** `compress-chat-message-text-v1` stores `content`,
  `opaqueContent`, `description` and `context` brotli-compressed. Compression is lossless and
  reversible; the text you read, export and back up is byte for byte what it always was. On the
  reference instance `chat_messages` was 515 MB and is projected at about 332 MB after the index and
  the compression together. Rewriting rows frees pages inside the file — run
  `npx quilltap db optimize` afterward to shrink the file itself.

#### Docs: plan for full-text message search and compressed message text, checked against the code

- `docs/developer/features/chat-message-fts5-and-compression.md` now matches the repository it
  describes. The FTS5 index is keyed through a small id-mapping table instead of the implicit rowid
  of a TEXT-keyed table (VACUUM may renumber it and a table rebuild silently drops triggers), a
  startup guard rebuilds a stale index, and the index and compression ship as two migrations so the
  search change can be reverted alone. The plan also records what was already true: `qt_text()` is
  registered on every connection, backup, restore, export and the job child all go through the
  repository, today's search silently returns nothing for a query containing a period, the CLI's
  message commands print the columns raw, transaction-scoped collections skip the codec, and the
  size figures predate the 4.10 storage work.

#### Changed: databases take about a quarter less disk

Three storage changes, measured end-to-end on a 2.0 GB reference instance, which came out at
1.48 GB afterward (492 MB, 24.9%). Every change is reversible, no conversation text or image is
lost, and searching, reading and exporting behave exactly as before. Rewriting rows frees pages
inside the files; run `npx quilltap db optimize` afterward to shrink the files themselves.

- **Images in document stores are normalized on write.** Transcoding used to be optional at each
  call site and eight write paths skipped it, so untranscoded PNGs and oversized lossless WebP
  accumulated. It now happens in one place that no write path can bypass. The
  `recompress-oversized-mount-blobs-v1` migration re-encodes what landed earlier: 149 images and
  191.8 MB on the reference instance, with dimensions unchanged. A `.qtap` import and an archive
  rehydrate still restore bytes exactly as archived.
- **LLM log payloads are compressed.** `llm_logs.request` is the same prompt scaffolding
  re-serialized on every call and was the single largest thing in the instance — 318 MB for seven
  days of logs. Compressing it reclaimed 208 MB, and the logs viewer and `quilltap db log` read it
  back unchanged.
- **Rendered conversation transcripts are compressed.** `conversation_chunks.content` duplicates
  the transcript for the Scriptorium; compressing it reclaimed 88.5 MB. It is regenerable either
  way — a render job rebuilds it from the chat's messages.

#### Fixed: stale chats kept one cache the maintenance sweep never cleared

The daily sweep clears a quiet chat's regenerable caches, but `compiledIdentityStacks` was never on
its list, so it accumulated on chats that had gone quiet — 13.5 MB across 841 stale chats on the
reference instance. It is a version-stamped read-through cache that rebuilds on the chat's next
turn, exactly like the other entries the sweep already cleared.

#### Changed: dependency update across the app, packages and plugins

`npm update -S` was run on the root project, every package under `packages/`, and all 15 distributed
plugins. No behavior changes are intended; the one code change below was forced by a type-inference
change in Zod.

- Root, notable versions: Next 16.3.4 to 16.3.5, React and React DOM 19.2.8 to 19.3.0, Zod 4.5.4 to
  4.6.5, `openai` 7.15 to 7.20, `@openrouter/sdk` 1.2.106 to 1.3.11, TanStack Query 5.102.8 to
  5.103.2, Playwright 1.62.1 to 1.63.0, Jest 30.5.1 to 30.5.2, plus `katex`, `mammoth`, `yaml`,
  `autoprefixer`, `tsx` and the `@types/*` packages.
- Packages published: `create-quilltap-theme` 2.0.20, `@quilltap/plugin-types` 2.7.1,
  `@quilltap/plugin-utils` 2.6.2, `theme-storybook` 1.0.72. `packages/quilltap` had nothing to
  update and was not bumped.
- All 15 plugins took a patch bump in both `package.json` and `manifest.json`, mostly for
  `@quilltap/plugin-types` ^2.6.0 to ^2.7.0, and were rebuilt with `npm run build:plugins`.
- Zod 4.6 changed what `.optional().prefault(x)` infers: it now yields `T | undefined` where 4.5
  yielded `T`, which broke the typecheck in three routes. The `.optional()` was redundant —
  `.prefault()` already accepts a missing key and substitutes the default — so it was dropped from
  all five places it appeared, in the project, character-prompt, plugin-search and image-generate
  schemas. Runtime parsing is unchanged.

#### Docs: one comprehensive CLI reference, in the package README

The CLI reference was split across `packages/quilltap/README.md` (what npm users get) and
`docs/developer/CLI.md` (what the release checklist called canonical). The package README is now
the single full reference, and `CLI.md` is a pointer plus the developer-only remainder.

- Merged into the README: the `db characters archives|archive|rehydrate|export` commands, `qtap://`
  URI addressing for the `docs` verbs (including `--uri` output and the `self`/`project`/`general`
  CLI limitation), the camelCase-columns note, `memories validate`, a new Locking section covering
  the five-minute heartbeat window and `--lock-status` / `--lock-clean` / `--lock-override`, the
  `link`-vs-`copy` link-group semantics, the Docker bind planner's user-visible rules, the two sync
  refusal cases that were missing (a second concurrent run; character-vault keystones report a
  `conflict` rather than being deleted), and the caveat that `instances restore-key` does not
  re-encrypt character archive bundles.
- `docs/developer/CLI.md` now holds only what does not belong in a published package README: the
  `scripts/start-quilltap-docker.ts` startup script and its bind planner, why the sync engine is
  server-side plus its module map, and the shell-completion template internals.
- Repointed `CLAUDE.md`, the release checklist's CLI item, the documentation catalogue, and
  `DEVELOPMENT.md`. The in-app `help/cli-*.md` pages are a separate layer and are unchanged.
- Design of record: `docs/developer/features/complete/cli-comprehensive-help.md`.

#### New: `quilltap sync` mirrors a document store to a directory

`npx quilltap sync <store> <path>` keeps a database-backed document store and a directory on disk
in step, in both directions. Edit a file in your own editor and the next run carries it into the
store; edit it in the Scriptorium and the next run carries it out.

- Compares by SHA-256 first, modification time second. Equal bytes with unequal clocks are
  re-stamped, not re-copied. After a content action both sides carry the winner's modified time and
  the older of the two creation dates.
- The side that changed wins. When both changed since the last run it is reported as a `conflict`
  and nothing happens; `--prefer store` or `--prefer disk` resolves it.
- Deletions propagate only when `.quilltap-sync.json` (a manifest the verb keeps in the directory)
  shows the entry was there at the last run. On a first run, or with `--no-manifest`, an entry
  present on one side is created on the other, never deleted. `--no-delete` suppresses propagation.
- Files and folders whose names begin with a dot are invisible to the sync in both directions —
  never copied, never deleted, on either side. `.quilltap-sync.json` is the one exception and never
  enters the store.
- A binary's description travels as `<file>.description.md` beside it. Editing the sidecar changes
  the caption; deleting it clears the caption. Text documents' descriptions are not synced and are
  reported once as a `skip`.
- Byte-preserving: a `.png` pushed from disk is stored as a `.png` with the same sha, not converted
  to WebP the way a Scriptorium upload would be.
- Empty folders are real on both sides. Hard-linked paths converge in a single run.
- Never reads or writes a chunk or an embedding vector. The store's existing post-write hooks
  re-index, because the sync writes through the same chokepoints as every other writer.
- Other flags: `--dry-run`, `--direction both|to-disk|to-store`, `--json`, `--port`. `--dry-run`
  changes nothing on either side, including not creating the directory; it says a real run would.
- Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 error or failed action, 2 unresolved conflict. `--dry-run` uses the same
  codes, so a script can gate on a clean plan.
- Refused for a filesystem or Obsidian store (it already is a directory), an archived character's
  vault, a store mid-conversion or mid-scan, a second concurrent run, and a manifest belonging to
  another store. A character vault's keystone files are never deleted from the store.
- The server must be running, as it already must for `quilltap docs write` on a database store. The
  path is resolved on the server: under Docker it must sit inside a bind mount.

New API: `POST /api/v1/mount-points/[id]?action=sync`. Engine in `lib/mount-index/sync/`.
Help: `help/cli-sync.md`.

#### Fixed: a character could open a new chat in the wrong scenario (bug 158)

Starting a new chat could produce a greeting set somewhere other than the scenario that was chosen
— a character greeting you from a swimming hole when the chat was set in an office. The scenario
shown in the UI was correct; the model was reading a different one.

Creating a chat wrote the chosen scenario into two columns: `scenarioText`, where it belongs, and
`contextSummary`, where a summary of what was actually said belongs. That second write is left over
from before `scenarioText` existed. Everything that reads `contextSummary` therefore treated a
brand-new chat as already summarized, and the greeting prompt's "Recent Conversations" section —
which inlines that column whole — handed the character the full text of some other chat's scenario,
positioned immediately before the instruction to greet. On one test instance 186 of 712 chats were
in this state.

- Chat creation no longer seeds `contextSummary`. Only the summarizer writes it.
- The greeting's "Recent Conversations" entries are now length-capped and closed with the same
  `read_conversation` note the per-turn recap uses, so an oversized or wrong entry cannot dominate
  the prompt.
- The Concierge's danger classification read the scenario through that seed without knowing it. It
  now reads `scenarioText` deliberately when a chat has no summary yet — same behavior, and its log
  reports `scenario` rather than claiming `summary`.
- A migration clears `contextSummary` on existing chats where it is byte-identical to the chat's own
  `scenarioText`. Real summaries are untouched: every chat that has been summarized at least once
  has had that column overwritten, so none match.
- `.qtap` import and backup restore apply the same rule to incoming chats, so a bundle made before
  this fix can't bring the problem back into an instance the migration has already cleaned.

#### Fixed: a file description saved at one path appeared at another (bug 157)

Setting a description on an image in a document store could write it to a different file with
identical bytes. A character vault keeps every avatar at both `photos/` and `images/history/`, and
because the store is content-addressed those two paths share one content row. The repository method
that saves a description takes a content id, and when the caller did not say which path it meant,
it picked one with `LIMIT 1`. The request returned 200 and the description showed up on the other
copy.

The path is now required, not inferred. Three callers were affected: the Scriptorium's description
field, the `.qtap` importer's extracted-text restore, and the cached caption the chat attach
generates — that last one also read from the correct row and wrote to the wrong one, so attaching
the same vault image ran the vision model again every time.

#### Fixed: writing a binary's bytes no longer blanks its description (bug 155)

Re-uploading an image over an existing path in the Scriptorium file manager, running
`quilltap docs write --force` on one, or copying a described image between stores erased its
description, its auto-generated caption, and its extraction status. `linkBlobContent` treated an
omitted metadata field as "set this to blank" on the update branch as well as the insert, and every
byte-preserving writer omits them.

An omitted field now means "keep what is there". An explicit empty description still clears it, and
a fresh insert still defaults to blank.

#### Fixed: overwriting a document no longer leaves the old chunks answering searches (bug 156)

A text document overwritten through the file manager's upload, `docs write --force`, a cross-store
copy, or a `doc_write_file` from an autonomous turn kept the previous revision's chunks. Semantic
search, `doc_grep`'s chunk fallback, and character document recall went on returning passages from
text that was no longer there, and nothing healed it short of `docs reindex --force`.

- Repointing a link at different content now deletes that link's chunks and sets `chunkCount` to 0,
  so the write announces itself. Hard-link siblings whose content moved are treated the same way.
- `rescanDatabaseMountPoint`'s predicate (`chunkCount === 0 || not converted`) therefore catches
  every un-re-chunked overwrite, including the in-child writes that defer chunking to it by design.
  Its docstring, which described a sha-drift check the code never performed, now describes what it
  does.
- The byte-preserving writer in `file-ops` now runs the same post-write re-chunk that
  `writeDatabaseDocument` does, factored into one shared helper.

#### Docs: plan for `quilltap sync`, and two bugs filed

- `docs/developer/features/cli-document-store-sync.md` is the approved plan for a new CLI verb that
  mirrors a database-backed document store to a directory in both directions: sha-256 plus
  modification-time comparison, matching created/modified times on both sides, a
  `.quilltap-sync.json` manifest for deletions and conflicts, a `<file>.description.md` sidecar for
  a binary's description, dotfiles ignored on both sides, no WebP transcoding, and nothing done to
  chunks or vectors. The engine runs in the server behind a new `?action=sync`.
- Bug 155 (open): writing a binary's bytes over an existing path blanks its description and
  extracted caption, because `linkBlobContent` treats an omitted field as "set to blank" on update.
- Bug 156 (open): overwriting a database-store document through `write-file`, `docs write --force`,
  or a job-child write leaves the old chunks in place, and `rescanDatabaseMountPoint` does not
  perform the sha-drift check its docstring describes.

#### Changed: Regenerating a message now shows what it is doing

Pressing the refresh icon on a character's message used to do nothing visible until the new line
appeared, sometimes half a minute later. It now reports itself:

- The message being regenerated dims and shows a "Regenerating..." plate.
- The plate is replaced by the new line as it streams in. The regeneration is now a streaming
  provider call, so text arrives token by token instead of all at once at the end. A provider that
  does not stream simply delivers the whole line when it is done.
- The status strip above the composer carries the stage ("Regenerating — gathering <name>'s
  memories and context...", "...sending to <name>...", "Regenerating <name>'s reply..."), the same
  way it does for a first-time turn.
- The composer is disabled and the message's action icons are greyed out for the duration, so a new
  message or a second re-roll can't land on a turn in flight.
- When the regeneration finishes, the swipe group selects the variant that was just generated. It
  previously kept whatever variant was selected before, so you could watch a new line arrive and
  then be shown a different one.

New API: `POST /api/v1/messages/[id]?action=swipe&stream=1` returns `text/event-stream`
(`status` / `content` delta / `reasoning` / `done` / `error` frames). Without `stream=1` the
endpoint still returns `201 Created` with the new swipe as JSON.

#### Fixed: `ChatComposer`'s `disabled` prop did nothing

The prop was declared and destructured but never wired to any input. Every control was gated on
`sending` alone. Both flags now shut the composer.

#### Added: Inform — out-of-character information a character receives before their next turn

The Salon composer has a new **Inform** button (the *i* in the left gutter, beside Pascal). It opens
a dialog where you pick one, several, or every LLM-controlled character in the chat and write a
short second-person passage — "You notice the clock has stopped." Each character you target
receives that passage verbatim as its own system block immediately after their system prompt on
their next generation, and then it is consumed for them.

Nothing is added to what you type: no preamble, no Host voice, no instruction not to mention it.
The passage is never spoken in the scene and it is not a standing instruction — once the character
has taken a turn, it is gone.

Details:

- **Targets** are LLM-controlled character seats only. Silent and absent seats can be informed and
  collect the passage whenever they next generate; impersonated seats are still LLM-controlled, so
  delivery waits for their next LLM turn. Seats you play yourself are not offered.
- **The transcript keeps a record** — a Host message carrying exactly what you typed, public when
  every eligible seat was targeted and whispered to the targets otherwise. Its chip reads
  "out of character". The record never reaches a model: it is stripped from every character's
  history, from the summarizer and the other cheap-LLM tasks, and from the Courier transport. It is
  not extracted as memory either.
- **A pending chip** above the composer names who is still owed an inform, with the first line of
  the body on hover and a × to cancel. Canceling before anyone has collected it also removes the
  record; canceling after some have collected it keeps the record and drops only the remaining
  targets.
- **Stacking**: several pending passages for the same character are delivered together, in posting
  order, separated by `---`.
- **Consumption is tied to a saved assistant message.** A provider failure that saves nothing, or a
  "nothing to add" turn pass, leaves the passage pending for the next attempt. Regenerating or
  swiping a message re-applies whatever that generation saw and never consumes, so a new inform
  posted since does not get spent on a re-roll.
- **Autonomous rooms** deliver informs on their next chained turn. Carina does not — it builds its
  own minimal call.
- Rows survive `.qtap` export/import and backup/restore, consumed ones included, so swipes stay
  honest after a round trip.

Known limitation: pending informs do not travel through a chat merge or continuation.

New table `chat_informs`, migration `add-chat-informs-table-v1`. Help: `help/inform.md`.

#### Docs: plan for Inform, out-of-character information delivered before a character's next turn

Added `docs/developer/features/salon-inform.md`, a plan for a Salon composer button that lets the
operator write a short second-person passage and target one, several, or every LLM-controlled
character with it. Each target receives the passage verbatim as a system block right after their
system prompt on their next generation, then it is consumed; a Host transcript message records
what was posted (public when everyone was targeted, whispered to the targets otherwise) but the
record itself never reaches a model. Covers a new `chat_informs` table, the `POST ?action=inform` /
`GET ?action=informs` / `POST ?action=cancel-inform` API, the `buildContext` insertion point between
the identity reminder and the compressed-history block, consumption tied to a persisted assistant
message so regenerate/swipe re-applies correctly, autonomous-room delivery, and export/import/backup.
No code changes yet.

#### Fixed: the star that sets a character's default system prompt did nothing (bug 154)

On **Aurora → Edit character → System Prompts**, pressing the star beside a prompt reported
"Default prompt updated" and left the **Default** badge where it was. The request it sent named an
action the server does not have, fell through to a generic character update that discards the field,
and came back successful. The checkbox in the **Edit Prompt** dialog was unaffected and is what
people have been using instead.

The star now sends the same request that dialog does, and the badge moves on the click rather than
after a refetch.

Underneath, a character's default prompt was recorded in two places — a flag on the prompt and a
column on the character — and each way of changing it updated only one. So a change that appeared to
work could still leave new chats opening with the old prompt. Both are now written together
wherever prompts are added, edited, deleted or promoted, including from the picker on the Details
tab. The order in which the two are consulted is stated in one place instead of five; two of those
five used to seed a chat with no system prompt at all when the two disagreed.

The **Edit Prompt** dialog is also wider. The formatting toolbar no longer runs off its right edge,
where the last several buttons could not be reached.

#### Fixed: document tools listed character vaults they would then refuse to open (bug 153)

A character whose **System Transparency** is off — the default — was shown character vaults by
`doc_list_files` and `doc_grep`, including her own and, with **Shared Vaults** on, her peers'. File
paths and all. Opening any of them was then refused.

System Transparency being off hides every character vault from the document tools, and that was
enforced when a tool opened a path but not when one listed what was available. Two faults in one:
the listing named the vaults the setting exists to hide, and a tool that offers a path and then
denies it looks broken to a model, which retries rather than accepting the boundary.

Listing and opening now consult the same rule. An opaque character sees group, project and general
stores and no vault at all; `mount_point: "self"` returns nothing, as it already did when opening.
Group stores stay reachable (bug 152), and a character with System Transparency on is unaffected.

#### Fixed: characters could not read or write their own group's document stores (bug 152)

A character whose **System Transparency** is off — the default — could not reach any group
document store with the `doc_*` tools. Not the group's official store, not any store linked to a
group she belongs to, by name or by ID. Project-linked stores and Quilltap General worked, which is
why it looked intermittent.

System Transparency being off hides every character vault from the document tools. It did that by
dropping the character's identity from the request, and group membership is derived from exactly
that identity — so hiding her vault also hid every store her groups keep. Only character vaults
were ever meant to be hidden; that is what the help page has always said.

The two are now separated: vaults are hidden by name, and the character's identity stays, so group,
project and global stores resolve as they always should have. The covenant is unchanged — her own
vault, her peers' vaults, and the reserved `self` shorthand all stay closed to an opaque character.

Also fixed: a store that exists but is out of reach from the current conversation now says so,
instead of reporting "not found" as though the name were misspelled. The old wording read to a
model as a typo, so it would retry the same request with different spellings — the reported case
spent eight minutes and ten tool calls guessing at a name it had right on the first attempt.
Character vaults are excluded from the new message, so it cannot disclose a vault the covenant
hides.

#### Fixed: a turn carrying freshly generated images failed with "Request Entity Too Large" (bug 151)

After several avatars or backgrounds were generated, the next turn on a profile with **Supports
image upload** ticked could fail outright with `413 Request Entity Too Large`, stopping the chain.
The error came from the provider's edge, not from its context window: the same turn was logged at
49,652 estimated tokens against a million-token window. Image bytes are not tokens, and nothing was
counting them. Two `gpt-image-2.5` avatars at 1024x1536 were 2.2 MB each of base64 — under the 4 MB
per-image limit, so neither was resized — and 4.52 MB together.

Images sent to a model are now trimmed to what a model needs to read them: capped at 1024 on the
long edge and compressed to a 500 KB ceiling per image, with a 2 MB budget across a single turn.
Measured on a real avatar, that is 2,339 KB of base64 down to 98 KB, with the portrait still fully
legible.

**Stored images are unchanged.** Files on disk keep their full resolution and quality; the gallery,
character albums, exports and backups all still hold the originals. The shrinking happens only on
the copy sent to a model, and is discarded after the request.

#### Fixed: the manual image-generation dialog's Generate button did nothing (bug 150)

The dialog posted to `/api/v1/images/generate`, a path no route serves — it resolved to the item
route with `id = "generate"`, a 404. The generate action actually lives at
`POST /api/v1/images?action=generate`. The dialog's own test suite never caught it because it
asserted against a fetch call the test made itself, never against what the component requests; it
now renders the real component and checks the URL.

#### Added: GPT Image 2.5 (Flare and Sunburst), and the rest of the OpenAI image parameters

Two new OpenAI image models: `gpt-image-2.5-flare` (faster and cheaper, at GPT Image 2 quality)
and `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst` (slower and more expensive, better at detailed editing). Dated
snapshots such as `gpt-image-2.5-flare-2026-09-08` resolve to their family automatically.

With them, four parameters the plugin never sent:

- **Quality** — `auto`/`low`/`medium`/`high` on every GPT Image model, plus `xhigh` and `max` on
  the 2.5 pair. Previously only DALL-E's `standard`/`hd` were offered, and quality was not sent to
  GPT Image models at all.
- **Background** — `transparent` cuts the subject out, which is what avatars want. Asking for
  transparency with a JPEG output format switches the format to PNG rather than flattening it.
- **Output format** and **output compression** — `png`/`jpeg`/`webp`, with compression applied only
  where it means something. The returned image's MIME type now matches the format requested
  instead of always claiming PNG.
- **Moderation** — `auto` or the less restrictive `low`. Not an off switch; OpenAI's usage policies
  still apply.

GPT Image 2 and both 2.5 models also accept arbitrary resolutions: any `WIDTHxHEIGHT` with both
edges divisible by 16, an aspect ratio between 1:3 and 3:1, and up to 3840x2160. Anything above
2560x1440 is experimental.

The OpenAI plugin now implements `getImageProviderOptionsSchema`, so the image-profile editor is
built per selected model instead of using the old hand-written panel — a model is never offered a
knob it would reject. Parameters a model does not accept are dropped with a warning rather than
sent, because the Images API rejects the whole request over one unknown value; an unusable size
falls back to 1024x1024.

Per-family capabilities live in one table (`plugins/dist/qtap-plugin-openai/image-models.ts`) that
the wire logic, the host's model list and the editor schema all read from.

The manual image-generation dialog's OpenAI controls were DALL-E-shaped too — its size list held
no GPT Image size but 1024x1024, and its quality picker offered only Standard/HD, with Standard
sent on every generation. Both lists now span the families, and quality defaults to sending
nothing so the profile's own setting stands.

The `openai` SDK is updated to 7.15.0 in the main app and all six plugins that use it.

`@quilltap/plugin-types` 2.7.0 widens `ImageGenParams.quality` past DALL-E's `standard`/`hd` to
cover the GPT Image tiers. The host stores and forwards the value without interpreting it, so the
union is the sum of what the plugins accept and each plugin validates its own model's subset.
Purely widening — no existing plugin changes behavior. The app now requires `^2.7.0`; the plugins
still build against `^2.6.0`, since none of their own code depends on the wider type.

#### Fixed: the new quality tiers were rejected by the HTTP generate routes

Caught in review. The GPT Image tiers reached the `generate_image` tool schema, but
`POST /api/v1/images?action=generate` and `POST /api/v1/image-profiles/[id]?action=generate` each
spelled the union out for themselves and still read `standard`/`hd` — so a profile could store
`max` and those routes would reject it before the provider was ever called. All three now share
one `imageQualitySchema` (`lib/image-gen/quality.ts`), pinned to `ImageGenParams['quality']` by
compile-time assertions in both directions: adding a tier to one without the other is now a build
error rather than a silent rejection. Image profile *saving* was never affected — `parameters` is
stored as an open bag.

#### Fixed: `generate_image`'s `size` parameter has never done anything (bug 149)

The params builder lets orientation outrank a raw `size`, deliberately — a caller asking for a
shape means the shape. But the handler passed `orientation: toolInput.orientation ?? 'square'`,
so the builder was told a shape had been requested on every call, and square's 1024x1024 landed on
top of whatever size the merge produced. No input survived it. The default is now injected only
when the model named no size of its own; an explicit orientation still wins over an explicit size.
The same line was also discarding the profile's configured default size.

#### Fixed: image profile size, quality and style were ignored in chat (bug 148)

The `generate_image` tool's schema declared `size`, `quality` and `style` with Zod `.default(...)`.
Zod applies those defaults when the key is absent, and the tool's parsed output is handed to the
params builder as *overrides* — which outrank the profile's stored settings by design. So every
image a character generated carried `standard`/`1024x1024`/`vivid` regardless of what the profile
said. The defaults are removed; an omitted field now leaves the profile's value in place. `count`
keeps its default of 1 deliberately.

#### Fixed: the Salon no longer guesses whose turn it is (bug 147)

The turn rotation for a cycle is drawn once and stored on the chat, so that every reader agrees
about who follows whom. The Salon recomputes "whose turn is it" in the browser from that stored
rotation plus the message history — but `GET /api/v1/chats/[id]` was not sending the two columns
it reads. Both arrived as `undefined`, which reads as an empty rotation and an empty
spoken-this-cycle set: exactly what a brand-new chat looks like.

So the browser never followed the rotation. It fell back to a fresh weighted-random pick on every
recompute, contradicting the decision the server had already made and saved. Two things showed it:

- The turn banner named the wrong character, and its **Skip** passed the wrong turn — recording
  "X declining the floor" for a character who had just spoken, and leaving the real turn
  outstanding so you were prompted twice. Worst in rooms where you drive two characters, where the
  server hands the floor from one of yours to the other.
- The participant sidebar's predicted order was a talkativeness guess rather than the real
  rotation, and no character was ever marked as having already spoken this cycle.

Both columns are now sent, as the JSON strings the turn code already parses, defaulting to `[]`
for rows that predate them. The turn API's response also carries the rotation, and the client no
longer discards it. A test now asserts directly that the browser and the server pick the same
speaker from the same inputs, rather than assuming it.

This supersedes the previous entry's diagnosis: bug 146's fix was necessary but not sufficient —
it keyed the banner to the browser's answer, which was itself wrong.

#### Fixed: Skip now passes the turn that is actually outstanding (bug 146)

When you drive two characters in one room — your own plus a guest whose pen you have taken up —
a message from one of them hands the floor to the other rather than making an LLM answer. That
part was right. What was wrong is that the banner above the composer named the character you had
*last written as*, not the one whose turn it was, and its **Skip** button passed that character's
turn.

So a post as the guest was followed by a prompt that looked like a second turn for the same guest.
Pressing Skip recorded "the guest declining the floor" — a turn the guest had never held, since
they had just spoken — left the real turn where it was, and prompted you again. Two passes for one
turn, and a false line in the transcript that the models then read.

The banner now speaks for whoever holds the floor. When the turn is one of yours, it names that
character and Skip passes that turn; when the composer is pointed at a different character of
yours, it says so instead of inviting words in the wrong voice. Between turns — when an LLM is up
next — it still offers to decline early for the character you are holding, as before.

#### Fixed: collapsing a duplicate avatar roll no longer deletes the photo you kept from it (bug 145)

Copying an avatar roll into a character's photo album does not make a second copy of the image — it
makes a second reference to the same stored bytes. The migration that collapses duplicate rolls
deleted those bytes by file, taking *every* reference with them. So collapsing a duplicate removed
the album photo too, and removed it precisely because you had kept it: keeping is what put the
second reference there.

Nothing recorded the album photo outside the document index, so the loss left nothing behind to
notice — no broken link, no missing-image placeholder, no row pointing at nothing.

The migration now deletes only the roll's own reference, and releases the bytes only if that was
the last one. A roll you had kept loses its entry in the avatar cache and keeps its photo. It uses
the same rule the Photo Gallery's own delete has always used, reached through the same shared
code, so the two can no longer disagree.

This has not shipped: 4.10.0 has never been released, so the only instances that ran the old
version are development ones. No repair is possible where it did run — the bytes are gone — and
none is needed anywhere else.

On the development instance it was found on, 199 of 1066 surviving avatar rolls (19%) shared their
bytes with a kept photo. Each was one collapse away from losing it.

#### Fixed: `--lock-clean` no longer says a stopped instance is still running (bug 144)

Stopping an instance and immediately running `quilltap db --lock-clean` printed:

> Lock is still being refreshed (heartbeat 82s ago) — its holder is alive. Cannot clean.
> Stop the running instance first, or use `--lock-override` to force.

Both sentences were wrong. The holder was not alive, and there was no instance to stop — this
branch is only reached after the process check has already come back dead. A lock stays claimed
until its heartbeat is five minutes old whether or not its process is still there, which is
deliberate: on systems where process checks are unreliable, that window is what stops a running
instance from having its lock cleaned out from under it.

The refusal was right; only what it said was wrong. It now reads:

> Lock heartbeat is still fresh (82s ago). Cannot clean.
> A lock counts as held until its heartbeat is 5 minutes stale, even if its process has gone. Wait
> it out, or use `--lock-override` to force.

Waiting is a remedy the old message did not mention at all. The five-minute figure is taken from
the setting the check itself uses, so the message cannot fall out of step with the behaviour. The
separate message for a lock genuinely held by a running instance is unchanged, because there
"stop the running instance first" is the right instruction.

Nothing else changes: the command still refuses, and still leaves the lock alone.

#### Changed: the avatar-roll migration now reports what it kept, not only what it collapsed (bug 143)

The migration's summary counted the rolls it collapsed and said nothing about the ones it
deliberately kept — a roll still serving as a character's portrait is kept and shares its
configuration's cache entry, on purpose. With that number missing from the record, ten such rolls
on a development instance were later mistaken for damage, and it took a database forensics session
to establish that all ten were correct.

The summary now ends with "kept N rolls still serving as character portraits". The migration also
checks its own work before finishing, and reports any duplicate it did not deliberately create.

That check runs *during* the migration rather than afterwards, which matters: a character's
portrait can be changed at any time, so asking later whether a roll was kept for a good reason
answers a different question. Two of the ten had had their portraits changed hours before the
inspection that flagged them, and a third character had been deleted outright.

Files: `migrations/scripts/collapse-duplicate-avatar-rolls-v1.ts`,
`__tests__/unit/migrations/collapse-duplicate-avatar-rolls.test.ts`.

#### Fixed: deleting a message that is not there no longer counts as a deletion (bug 142)

`deleteMessagesByIds` reported the number of message IDs it was *asked* about, not the number of
rows it actually deleted. Asked to delete one ID that did not exist, it reported deleting one.

Nothing was lost or corrupted — the chat's message count and last-message time are recomputed from
the messages that survive, so they landed on the right values either way. Two things were wrong:

- Every caller that logs the result was logging a number that could not be false. The Commonplace
  Book's whisper sweep reported "swept N" whether or not it swept anything.
- Since the transcript counter was added, a delete that removed nothing still bumped it and told
  every open Salon tab on that chat that its transcript had changed. Each tab re-read the
  transcript and was handed the one it already had.

The cause was a check for return values the database layer cannot produce. The code tested whether
the delete returned a number, then fell back to testing whether it was truthy — but a delete always
returns a `{ deletedCount, acknowledged }` record, and a miss returns that record with a count of
zero. An object is truthy, so a miss was counted as a deletion, and the total could only ever equal
the number of IDs requested. Six of the seven callers of this database method already read
`deletedCount` directly; this was the only one that did not.

A delete that removes nothing now returns zero, logs nothing, leaves the transcript counter alone,
and tells no one. A batch that removes some of what it was asked about reports only what it
removed, and still announces the change — because it did change the transcript.

The reason this survived is worth recording: the test suite's stand-in for the database returned a
plain `0` or `1`, which took the one branch where the arithmetic was correct. The test named *says
nothing when nothing was removed* had been passing against a database that does not exist. That
stand-in was corrected first, which made the test fail on its own before anything else changed. The
lasting guard is a new suite that runs the real code against a real database instead of a stand-in,
and separately pins what the database layer actually returns.

#### Fixed: a migration test was passing over a helper that did not exist

`add-profile-multi-character-prefill-field.integration.test.ts` replaced the migration's database
helpers with a stand-in that was missing two of them — `sqliteColumnExists` and
`addColumnIfMissing`, both of which the migration calls. Six of its seven tests failed with
`sqliteColumnExists is not a function`, so the migration's column-add and its Anthropic backfill
were not being exercised at all. Only the test double was wrong; the helpers exist and the
migration itself is fine.

Files: `__tests__/unit/lib/database/migration/add-profile-multi-character-prefill-field.integration.test.ts`.

#### Fixed: the native-binding ABI heal now actually rebuilds

After a Node.js upgrade, the SQLCipher native addon is compiled against the old ABI and throws
`NODE_MODULE_VERSION` on load, turning every real-binding test suite red. Both the jest globalSetup
heal and the CLI's `ensureDatabaseNativeModule()` were supposed to fix that automatically. Neither
did.

Both shelled out to `npm rebuild <name>`, which fails two different ways:

- **`npm rebuild better-sqlite3`** (the alias the root install uses) is refused with
  `EALLOWSCRIPTS`. npm no longer runs install scripts for a package that is not listed in the root
  `package.json` `allowScripts` map, which is keyed `name@version` — the alias is not a key there.
- **`npm rebuild better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`** at the repo root *is* allowed, reports `rebuilt
  dependencies successfully`, and rebuilds a phantom directory. The stale binary is untouched. A
  false success is worse than an error: the heal reported it had worked and the suites stayed red.

Rebuilds are now addressed by **directory** rather than by npm package name, and run the package's
own build chain in place — `prebuild-install`, falling back to `node-gyp rebuild --release`, which
is exactly what its `install` script does. No name resolution, no npm script policy.

The new helper also **verifies the result instead of trusting the exit code**: it re-reads the
compiled-for ABI out of the binary afterwards and only reports success once it matches the running
Node. A tool that exits 0 without changing anything is now reported as the failure it is, naming
every attempt and what the binding still says.

#### Fixed: a silent provider no longer freezes chat creation (bug 141)

Creating a chat could hang forever at *Setting the opening scene…*, with the Green Room dialog stuck
open. That dialog cannot be dismissed while creation runs, so the only way out was reloading the
window.

The cause was a provider that accepted the streaming request, sent response headers, and then never
sent a chunk. Nothing caught it. Provider SDK timeouts stop at the response headers — which is what
makes them safe to use on a streaming path, and useless once the headers arrive — so a response body
that never starts was outside every timeout in the app. The chat itself was already fully built by
that point; only the opening line, and the HTTP response, were missing.

Provider streams are now watched for silence. A stream gets a generous budget for its first chunk
(four minutes, since a long prompt with extended thinking legitimately takes minutes to start) and a
tighter one between chunks (two minutes). The opening greeting gets tighter budgets still — 90
seconds and 60 seconds — because it is short and runs behind the blocking dialog.

What happens when a stream goes silent:

- **In a chat**, the turn fails over to the connection profile's understudy, the same as any other
  network failure.
- **During chat creation**, the greeting stops retrying that profile. The remaining attempts go
  back to the same silent provider, so the chat opens with its scripted greeting instead. A silence
  at the Concierge's uncensored profile is the exception: that is a different provider, so the
  character's own profile is still tried.
- **In the log**, `[LLMStream] Abandoned a stalled provider stream` names the provider, the model,
  the budget, and how many chunks had arrived.

A stalled request is abandoned, not cancelled — the provider plugin owns its connection. Killing the
socket needs a change to the plugin interface and is not in this release.

Not affected: slow streams that keep producing. The budget applies to each gap between chunks, not
to the total, so a long answer is never cut off for being long. Thinking models emit reasoning
chunks while they think, and those count.

#### Changed: a paused chat no longer generates anything on its own (bug 137)

**Pause** in the participants sidebar stopped the turn chain, not the chat. Every message you sent
still drew exactly one reply, and **Nudge** and **Skip** silently cleared the pause before running,
so one nudge put the chat back in the normal rotation.

A paused chat now only advances when you ask it to, one turn at a time:

- **Sending a message** saves it in full — attachments, staged tool results, auto-detected dice
  rolls, inline `@Name:` queries — and generates no reply. The chat stays paused. The first message
  sent during each pause shows a notice explaining this, so the silence isn't mistaken for a failed
  send.
- **Nudge** and **Skip** run exactly one turn and stop. Neither clears the pause.
- **Resume** returns the chat to the normal rotation.

Two related fixes. The `nudge` flag was dropped by a wrapper between the sidebar button and the
server; it is what withholds the "nothing to add" skip option, so a nudged character could pass the
turn — in a paused chat, that means no turn at all (bug 138). And **Continue** in the all-LLM pause
dialog now works: it cleared no pause and requested no turn, so the button meant to restart a
runaway chat only closed the dialog (bug 139).

Also removed: the `isPaused` / `onTogglePause` props passed from the Salon through the message list
to every message row. Neither was rendered, and the memo comparison on `isPaused` re-rendered the
whole viewport on each pause toggle (bug 140). The sidebar Pause button is unaffected.

Not affected: autonomous rooms, which use `runState` and never read this flag; the Courier, which
uses the same flag to hold a chat while waiting for a pasted reply; and the all-LLM turn thresholds
that trigger the dialog.

#### Fixed: a send refused while a reply is still streaming now says so (bug 136)

Pressing Enter in the Salon while a reply was still generating did nothing at all — no notice, no
flash, no log line. The line stayed in the composer and a second press after the turn landed worked,
but in the moment there was no way to tell "I declined to send that" from "something went wrong",
which is the same silence a genuinely broken send produces.

One `return` in `sendMessage` covered two quite different cases. The empty-composer half is correct
and wants no feedback. The `sending` half is a real request refused, and now answers: **One moment —
the room is still speaking. Your remark waits in the composer.** The **Nudge**, **Continue** and
**Skip** controls get the same notice when they are refused for the same reason, being clicks on
explicit controls. A paused chat still declines silently, the sidebar having already said so, and an
empty composer still says nothing.

`__tests__/unit/hooks/useSSEStreaming-send-guard.test.tsx` (new).

#### Removed: a Stop/Pause flag that was written four times and read nowhere (bug 135)

`userStoppedStreamRef` looked like the latch the SSE read loop consults before acting on an event
that arrives after a Stop. It consulted nothing: the ref had four writers and no readers anywhere in
the checkout. Stopping a turn works, and always worked, because `stopStreaming` aborts the
`AbortController` and the fetch dies.

No behaviour changes. The ref, its writes, the parameter it occupied in `sendMessage` and in the In
Their Own Words dialog's `SendMessageArgs`, and both pass-throughs in `SalonView` are deleted;
`sendMessage` takes seven arguments instead of eight. No race was demonstrated, so the flag went
rather than gaining a reader — a write-only ref type-checks and lints clean, so the next person to
reach for it would have wired a stop-sensitive branch to a guard that is never consulted.

#### Avatar Rolls section in a character's Photo Gallery

The Photo Gallery tab on a character's Aurora page has a new collapsible section below the album:
**Avatar Rolls**. It lists every portrait the avatar configuration cache holds for that character —
one image per configuration of outfit, image provider, profile and model — with the same actions the
album offers, plus one of its own:

- **Set as avatar** — saves the roll into the album (if it isn't there yet) and points the
  character's portrait at the resulting album link.
- **Keep in the photo album** — hard-links the roll into the character's `photos/` folder. Idempotent;
  a roll already kept shows a filled bookmark and the button is disabled.
- **Download**, **view** (with the generation prompt), and **Save to my gallery** from the enlarged
  view, as in the album.
- **Delete** (two clicks to confirm) — clears every pointer at the roll first (`chats.characterAvatars`,
  `avatarOverrides`, and a legacy `defaultImageId`), then drops the roll's own mount link. **A copy
  you had kept in the album is not deleted.** The cache treats the missing configuration as a miss,
  so the next time the character wears that outfit a new portrait is generated.

Membership is `files.generationKey IS NOT NULL` plus the character's id in `files.tags`, so it covers
rolls stored under `character-avatars/` (before avatars moved into the vault), `images/history/`
(since), and rolls already copied into `photos/`.

New endpoints: `GET /api/v1/characters/[id]/avatar-rolls`,
`POST /api/v1/characters/[id]/avatar-rolls/[fileId]?action=save-to-album|set-avatar`,
`DELETE /api/v1/characters/[id]/avatar-rolls/[fileId]`.

**Behavior change:** the character photo album no longer lists images under `images/history/`. Those
are avatar rolls and now appear only in the new section; previously each one showed in both places on
the same page. `images/avatar.webp` still appears in the album.

#### Wardrobe dialog: "Show shared"

The Wardrobe dialog's item list has a second tickbox beside **Show archived**: **Show shared**, on by
default. Unticking it hides the rows merged in from a shared tier (group, project, Quilltap General)
— the ones badged `· shared` — leaving only garments the character owns, which makes dressing a
character or composing an outfit out of her own clothes a good deal easier.

Unlike **Show archived**, which re-fetches every tier with `?includeArchived=true`, this is a
client-side filter: ownership is a property of the merge, not something the fetch can ask for. It
uses the same `canManage` predicate that badges the row, so the badge and the filter can't disagree.
The tickbox is hidden when browsing a shared container directly, where every row belongs to the
container on display.

#### Character avatars are cached per configuration

A character wearing the same outfit no longer costs a fresh image every time. The avatar prompt is
built from deterministic inputs only, so the prompt plus the built image-generation parameters
(provider, profile, model, LoRAs, options, size) hash to a `generationKey` stored on the `files`
row. Before generating, the avatar job looks that key up; if a matching image is found and its bytes
still exist, it is reused and the job stops there — skipping the Concierge classification call, the
image call, the WebP conversion and the file write. Put the coat back on later and the same portrait
comes back.

The **Regenerate Avatar** button now behaves as a reroll. It sets `force`, which bypasses the lookup,
generates a new image, and rebinds the key to it, so the new portrait becomes the one that outfit
returns from then on. It affects that character in that outfit only — the character's own default
portrait is a separate image and is not touched.

Generated avatars are now always stored in the character's vault, whether or not the chat belongs to
a project. Project-context avatars no longer show up in that project's file tree; existing files keep
their storage location and still display. One consequence: a character whose vault is missing or
broken now gets no avatar at all, where before a project chat could still produce one.

A cache hit posts no Lantern announcement, since nothing was generated. The avatar still updates in
the Salon as usual.

#### Migration: duplicate avatar rolls are collapsed

`collapse-duplicate-avatar-rolls-v1` brings existing avatars into the cache. Avatar rows are grouped
by prompt and model; the newest row in each group survives and receives the cache key, and the rest
are deleted — the `files` row plus the stored image, chunks and links. Every reference to a deleted
row is repointed to the survivor: `chats.characterAvatars`, `characters.avatarOverrides`, and
chat message attachments, including the file uuid the Lantern quotes inline in its announcement text.

This is destructive and visible. The duplicates were not redundant copies of the same image; they
were separate generations of the same prompt. Chats that displayed one of the deleted rolls now
display the surviving one instead, and this cannot be undone. On the instance it was measured
against, 1786 avatar rows collapsed to 889, freeing about 141 MB. Rows with no generation prompt are
skipped, and a group with only one row keeps it and gains a key.

`add-file-generation-key-column-v1` runs first and adds the nullable `files.generationKey` column and
its index.

#### The Salon transcript is now a subscribed read

A message written into a chat now reaches every open tab on that chat, whether or not the tab was
the one that asked for it. Until now there was exactly one path: the read loop of the
`POST /api/v1/messages` fetch the tab itself issued. If that stream was gone — the operator tabbed
away during a long generation, the machine slept, the connection dropped — the reply was persisted
correctly and never appeared, and no error was logged anywhere, because a write to a closed
controller is swallowed and a client that has gone away is indistinguishable from one that is
listening. The same gap is why staff messages written from the forked job child (Aurora wardrobe
notes, Lantern backdrops, Commonplace whispers, Suparṇā's mail announcements) showed up only if
they happened to be enqueued into an open stream at the right moment.

The message write funnel (`ChatMessagesOps`) now publishes `{topic:'chats', id}` on every add,
add-batch, edit, delete and clear, and `useChatData` listens for it and re-reads the transcript.
The re-read is the authority; SSE keeps carrying tokens for the turn being generated but no longer
decides what the room contains. A dropped stream costs a typing animation instead of a turn.

The re-read is conditional, which is what makes subscribing affordable. A new `transcriptVersion`
counter on the chat row is bumped in the same update as the publish, and
`GET /api/v1/messages?chatId=&action=transcript&knownVersion=N` answers `{unchanged: true}` when the
counter still agrees. One busy turn fires wardrobe, backdrop, whisper and memory hints at the same
topic; they now cost round trips, not re-serialized transcripts.

Two pieces of state a mid-conversation refetch used to trample are now preserved. Swipe selection
is carried across by the selected variant's id rather than its index, so a regenerate that appends
a variant no longer yanks the view onto a different reply. Rows that did not change keep their
object identity, and a read that changed nothing returns the very array it was given, so the
virtualizer does not remeasure and the scroll position holds.

An optimistic bubble is now a true overlay: it is dropped the moment the authoritative read carries
a row for it, matched on role and text first and on "a new row of the same role, no older than the
bubble" second (an attachment send stores different text than it displays). A send that never
persisted at all is swept at the turn boundary instead of sitting in the transcript forever.

The counter is a `chats` column but deliberately not a field on the chat entity. Every repository
update rewrites the whole validated row from a snapshot it read moments earlier, so a counter inside
the schema could be rewound by any concurrent chat-row write — two messages landing together would
leave it where a tab that read in between already thinks it is, and that tab would never be shown
the second one. Zod strips what it does not declare, so no `update()` can touch the column and
`SET v = v + 1` is its only writer. Being outside the entity also keeps it out of `.qtap` exports
and backups without any special-casing, and an import starts at zero because it simply isn't in the
bundle.

Search-and-replace announces too. `replaceInMessages` rewrites message rows directly, outside the
add/update/delete funnel; without an announcement an open Salon would go on being told "unchanged"
while every line it displayed had its text rewritten underneath it.

Also in this change: the transcript projection — attachments, pre-rendered HTML, off-scene author
cards — moved out of the chat GET handler into `lib/chat/transcript-projection.ts`, so the mount
read and the conditional re-read cannot drift apart. Both readers take the counter before projecting,
so the version handed to a tab is never newer than the rows beside it. The transcript endpoints now
verify chat ownership, matching the per-message endpoints. The terminal's `chat-update` and
`terminal-exited` browser events now use the cheap transcript read instead of refetching the whole
chat.

Filed while implementing, not fixed here: bug 135 (`userStoppedStreamRef` is written four times and
read nowhere, so Stop and Pause gate nothing) and bug 136 (a send refused because one is already in
flight returns silently, which is indistinguishable from a send that failed).

#### Docs: plan for the Salon transcript as a subscribed read

Added `docs/developer/features/salon-realtime-transcript.md`, a plan to stop the SSE stream being
the only way a message reaches an open Salon tab. The transcript is a plain `useState` array filled
once at mount, so nothing can tell it it is stale: an interrupted stream loses the turn it was
carrying, and staff messages written by the forked child — Aurora wardrobe notes, Lantern backdrops,
Commonplace whispers — show up only if they happened to be enqueued into an open stream at the right
moment. The plan has a chat-scoped realtime hint drive a re-read of the transcript and demotes the
stream to a display-only overlay for the turn in flight, leaving token streaming and the turn
manager alone. Records that child-written messages already publish `{topic:'chats', id}` through the
job dispatcher's post-commit hook, so the publish half is largely built and nothing is listening.
Covers the publish site at the message write funnel, a conditional read so a hint storm costs round
trips instead of payloads, the reconciliation rule between the streaming bubble and the
authoritative rows, and the swipe-selection and scroll-anchor state a mid-turn refetch would
otherwise disturb. Also records two defects found while diagnosing the incident behind it:
`userStoppedStreamRef` is written in three places and never read, so Stop and pause gate nothing,
and the Salon's send returns silently when a send is already in flight.

#### Fixed: a chat setting changed while a Salon tab was open never reached it (bug 134)

Flipping a Settings → Chat dial — auto-scroll, thinking display, token display, the LLM inspector
button, story backgrounds — did not affect a chat already open in another workspace tab. The chat
kept the old value until it was reloaded or closed and reopened. The setting itself saved
correctly; a newly opened chat honoured it.

`SalonView` read its settings from `useChatData`, which fetched `/api/v1/settings/chat` once from
the mount effect into `useState`. That was fine when a Salon was a page and navigating to Settings
unmounted it. The tabbed workspace renders every tab at once and hides the inactive ones with
`display: none`, so a backgrounded Salon never unmounts and never re-runs the effect — the value
was a snapshot of whenever the tab was opened.

Every settings read in the Salon now goes through `useChatSettingsQuery`, the same shared query the
composer plugins already used. Saving a dial invalidates that key, which TanStack delivers to every
mounted observer including a hidden tab, so an open chat follows the change without remounting (and
without interrupting a stream). `fetchChatSettings` and the `chatSettings` state are gone from
`useChatData`. The Salon's own duplicate `ChatSettings` interface, plus the four sub-shapes it
referenced, are now re-exports of `components/settings/chat-settings/types` — one declaration of the
row instead of two. The memory-cascade "remember my choice" write also invalidates the key, which
it never did.

#### Fixed: both voice rehearsals were logged as chat summaries

`mapTaskTypeToLogType` is a closed allowlist, and an unmapped task type falls through to
`SUMMARIZATION` rather than failing. Neither `announcement-rewrite` (the Insert Announcement
rehearsal, since 4.4) nor the new `impersonation-voice-rewrite` was mapped, so both filed
themselves as chat summaries — indistinguishable from real summarization in the Almanack's Wire
Records and in the LLM inspector's filter groups. Added an `LLMLogType` of `VOICE_REWRITE` and
mapped both to it. `llm_logs.type` is plain `TEXT` with no constraint, so no migration is needed;
existing rows keep whatever they were written with. The mapping now has a test, since the failure
mode is silent.

#### Added: impersonated lines can be restated in the character's own voice before posting

New instance setting, Settings → Chat → Composer, default off. With it on, a line typed while
impersonating a character (the Impersonate button) opens a review dialog instead of posting: the
seat's own model restates the draft in that character's voice, and the operator can send the
restatement (edited or not), regenerate it, go back to the composer and rewrite, or send the
original as written. Nothing reaches the chat until they choose.

The rewrite reuses the Insert Announcement rehearsal's core but frames the character as *in* the
scene rather than outside it: the seat's own connection profile and system prompt, the chat's
roleplay template, Taboo phrases, standing instructions, the last 12 played messages shaped as that
seat would see them (whispers it isn't party to excluded, `[Name]` attribution in a
multi-character room), and a Commonplace Book recall against the draft. No tool instructions. A
chat the Concierge has flagged follows its turns onto the uncensored route; a refusal surfaces as
an ordinary preview failure and never escalates on its own.

The Salon reads the setting through the TanStack query rather than the Salon's mount-only settings
fetch, so flipping the toggle takes effect on a chat that is already open — a workspace tab keeps a
Salon mounted indefinitely, so a mount-only read would never have seen it. Eight other Salon
settings reads still have that staleness; filed as bug 134.

The gate never fires for a `controlledBy: 'user'` seat (owner persona, or a seat flipped to user
control), for an attachment-only or tool-result-only send, or for a Carina address — `@Name:` is
machinery and must survive verbatim. Document Mode edits don't pass through the send path and are
unaffected. "Send as written" and "Edit original" stay available after a failed preview, so a dead
provider can't trap a draft.

Nothing extra is persisted. The posted message is an ordinary user-authored message attributed to
the impersonated seat, exactly as before; the rewrite's audit trail is its `llm_logs` row, filed
under the new `VOICE_REWRITE` type (see the entry above).

#### Fixed: a moderated chat's story background could escalate to the uncensored image provider

A chat the Concierge had never flagged — no override, `isDangerousChat` false — could receive a
story background generated by the uncensored image provider, from a prompt written to be explicit.
Bug 133.

Two defects in series:

- `sanitizeAppearancesIfNeeded` skipped sanitizing appearance text it had just classified as
  dangerous whenever an uncensored image profile was configured anywhere in settings, on the
  assumption that such text is routed there. That holds for the image-generation tool, which
  classifies each prompt and reroutes on the spot under `AUTO_ROUTE`. It does not hold for story
  backgrounds, which never route up front — a moderated chat's backdrop goes to the moderated
  provider whatever the classification says. Raw "naked, barefoot" appearance text therefore
  reached the prompt crafter, and the moderated provider refused what came back. The parameter is
  now `routesDangerousToUncensored` and callers answer for the scene in hand: story backgrounds
  pass `uncensoredImageTarget`, the image tool passes `AUTO_ROUTE && uncensoredImageProfileId`
  (so it sanitizes under `DETECT_ONLY`, where nothing reroutes).
- The story-background job's post-hoc reroute — its retry on the uncensored profile after a
  provider rejects an image for content — was gated on the global `AUTO_ROUTE` setting alone and
  never on the chat's own Concierge state. It then re-crafted the prompt candidly *because* the
  chat was moderated, on the reasoning that a prompt written for a moderated provider must be
  needlessly coy. A moderated chat got the strongest escalation available, triggered by the
  refusal that should have stopped it. The reroute now also requires `isDangerousChat`. That makes
  the re-craft unreachable — any reroute is now a chat whose prompt was already candid — so it is
  deleted and the prompt is resent as-is.

A moderated chat whose story background is refused now fails the job and produces no image, which
is the intended outcome. The concealment prompting itself is unchanged and remains permissive
enough that a cheap model may satisfy it by naming an undressed state rather than concealing it;
that is tracked separately.

`lib/background-jobs/handlers/story-background.ts`,
`lib/tools/handlers/image-generation-handler.ts`, `help/dangerous-content.md`.

#### Fixed: `describe_image` on a generated picture returned its label, not a description

The story-background job stored `Story background for: <scene or chat title>` and the
wardrobe-portrait job stored `<Name> — wardrobe portrait` in the `description` column of every
image they produced, on both the `files` row and its Scriptorium link. `describe_image` served
whatever sat in that column before it would read the generation prompt or spend a vision call, so
a character asking what a backdrop showed was told the chat title. Bug 132.

Three changes:

- Neither job writes the label any more. `description` is left null; the generation prompt and
  revised prompt were already stored beside it and are the account of record.
- `describe_image` now prefers the generation prompt over a stored description, the same order
  `runGenerateImageDescription` (the blind-model attachment fallback) has always used. When both
  exist the stored description is returned too, as `stored_description` and an `On file:` line in
  the formatted text, so a human-written or vision-written description is never hidden behind the
  prompt. This also covers a `.qtap` import from an older export that still carries a label.
- A new migration, `clear-generated-image-placeholder-descriptions-v1`, clears the two label
  shapes already on disk: `files.description` to NULL on `source = 'GENERATED'` rows, and
  `doc_mount_file_links.description` to its `''` default on image links. Real descriptions,
  uploads, and non-image links are untouched. An unreadable mount index degrades the link sweep
  to a warning rather than failing the migration.

`migrations/scripts/clear-generated-image-placeholder-descriptions.ts`, `help/keep-image-tools.md`.

#### Fixed: a user-controlled character's talkativeness now counts in the speaking order

Talkativeness on a character you drive yourself had no effect on the rotation. The six server paths
that pick a speaker each built their own `characterId -> Character` map first, and four of them
built it from `getActiveCharacterParticipants`, which returns LLM-controlled seats only. A seat you
control was therefore missing from the map, so the draw fell back to the 0.5 default for it unless
the seat carried a per-chat talkativeness override, and an archived character on such a seat was
never filtered out of the rotation. The help text has always said talkativeness applies to user
characters; now it does. This predates the cycle-order change — the old one-at-a-time pick had the
same blind spot — but it matters more now that the whole rotation is drawn from those weights at
once.

The six hand-rolled loops are replaced by one helper, `loadRoomCharacters`
(`lib/chat/turn-manager/room-characters.ts`), which builds the map over `getPresentCharacterSeats`
— every present character seat, whoever drives it. `loadAllParticipantData`, which builds the same
map for prompt construction rather than for selection, now uses it too.

It is also fewer queries. The loops called `repos.characters.findById` per seat, and each of those
overlays one character's vault with eleven queries plus the row read; the helper calls `findByIds`
once, which overlays the whole room in a single batch whatever the seat count. A four-seat room
goes from roughly 48 queries per selection to 12.

Failure handling changes with it. `findById` throws `CharacterVaultUnavailableError` when a
character's vault is unreadable, which used to throw straight out of speaker selection and take the
turn — and the read-only `?action=turn` request behind the participant sidebar — with it. The
batched read logs and drops such a character instead, which is what the consumers were already
written for: a seat whose character is missing from the map stays in the rotation at the default
weight rather than silently vanishing from the room. On the prompt path the same change means a
shelved vault costs the prompt that character's contribution rather than failing the whole reply,
which is the policy `findNamesByIds` already applied there.

`GET /api/v1/chats/[id]?action=turn` also stops reporting a user-driven seat as `nextSpeakerName:
null` and `participant.name: "Unknown"`, since that seat's character is now in the map it reads
names from. Filed as bug 131.

#### Changed: a multi-character chat draws its speaking order once per cycle

The rotation for a cycle is now decided up front and kept. When a cycle begins, the turn manager
draws the whole order — a talkativeness-weighted permutation of the present character seats,
sampled without replacement — stores it on the chat, and follows it seat by seat until the cycle
wraps, at which point it draws a new one. Previously each turn made its own weighted pick from
whoever had not yet spoken, so the order could not be known before it happened.

The distribution of rotations is unchanged: drawing the permutation up front and drawing it one
element at a time are the same successive-sampling procedure. What changes is that the order is
knowable in advance, so the sidebar's Participants list shows the real sequence instead of the
talkativeness-sorted guess it used to display below the queue. Position 3 now means third.

Stored as `chats.cycleOrderParticipantIds` (added by `add-cycle-order-column-v1`): the participants
who have yet to speak this cycle, in order. It is consumed at the same write chokepoints that
advance `spokenThisCycleParticipantIds` — a message landing, a skipped user turn, an LLM's "nothing
to add" pass — and drawn by `resolveCycleOrder` (`lib/chat/turn-manager/cycle-order.ts`), the single
writer, which every server path that asks "who is next" now calls first: the chain loop, the
first-responder resolver, the message finalizer, `?action=turn`, and the autonomous-room handler.
The client reads the stored order and never draws one.

Mid-cycle cast changes are repaired rather than redrawn: a departed seat or archived character is
skipped when the order is read, and a character who joins mid-cycle is appended to the back and
dealt in properly at the next draw. A one-character chat stores no rotation. Selection keeps the old
one-at-a-time weighted pick as its fallback for any chat with no rotation on file yet, so existing
conversations carry on without a migration of their turn state. The manual queue still jumps the
line, and a summoned character is struck from the remaining order so they do not speak twice.

#### Added: the Salon chat gallery

The **Gallery** button in a chat's Organize drawer now opens a grid of every image in the
conversation, whatever produced it: uploads and library links, `generate_image` output, images from
either Generate Image entry point, story backgrounds the Lantern painted (including superseded
ones), Aurora avatar repaints (likewise), pictures re-shown from a photo album, files the Librarian
attached from a document store, the cast's standing portraits, and images referenced only by a
Markdown link in message prose. Previously the listing covered the first six and the button never
appeared at all (bug 129).

One server-side enumerator, `lib/photos/chat-gallery.ts`, is the single place that knows all nine
sources; the `/chats/[id]/files` listing now shares its message-attachment walk rather than keeping
a second copy. It answers on `GET /api/v1/chats/[id]?action=gallery` with entries, per-source
counts, and a total. Each entry carries whether its id is a `files.id` or a
`doc_mount_file_links.id`, which source it came from, whether it is the background the chat is
currently showing or the avatar a character is currently wearing, and whether the chat owns the
record well enough to delete it. Entries are deduped by content hash and sorted newest first, with
standing portraits at the end.

The grid has a filter chip per source with its count (chips for empty sources are hidden, and the
row disappears entirely when everything came from one place), a `current` badge on the background
and avatars presently in play, and Save / Download / Delete on hover. Delete appears only where the
chat minted the record — never a portrait, a kept album image, an inline reference, or the
background and avatar currently on display. The modal now renders through a portal to the document
body, so it is not trapped under the toolbar inside the tabbed workspace.

Save opens the same album dialog the message toolbar's bookmark opens — the full album list, the
caption field, the duplicate notice. Because half the gallery has no message to be attached to, it
posts to a new chat-scoped `POST /api/v1/chats/[id]?action=save-image` whose guard is gallery
membership rather than message attachment; both routes share one Zod body schema, one attribution
resolver (`lib/photos/save-attribution.ts`), and one album service. The message route's behaviour is
unchanged except that `ALREADY_SAVED` now reads as a duplicate notice in the dialog. The detail
view's two hard-wired "first character" album buttons are removed in favour of that dialog, and it
gains a provenance line and a Jump-to-message link.

The sidebar's `Gallery (N)` count and the grid are now one TanStack Query read
(`queryKeys.chats.gallery`), which rides the existing `chats` realtime topic — so a Lantern backdrop
or an Aurora repaint landing from a background job updates the number with no poll. `chatPhotoCount`
and `fetchChatPhotoCount` are gone from `useChatData`.

New help page `help/chat-gallery.md`; `chat-participants.md`, `chat-message-actions.md` and
`photo-gallery.md` updated to point at it.

#### Changed: image routes accept `?download=1`

`GET /api/v1/files/[id]`, `GET /api/v1/files/proxy/[...key]` and
`GET /api/v1/mount-points/[id]/blobs/[...path]` now honour `?download=1` (or `download=true`) by
serving `Content-Disposition: attachment` instead of `inline`. Nothing else about the response
changes — content type, length, cache headers and `X-Blob-Sha256` are all as before, and a
non-ASCII filename still carries its RFC 5987 `filename*`.

The client helpers `downloadImageUrl` / `downloadGalleryEntry` in `lib/download-utils.ts` append the
flag and hand the URL to `triggerUrlDownload` rather than fetching the bytes into a Blob first. In
the Electron shell that streams a 4K story background straight to disk through `will-download`
instead of through renderer memory. `ImageModal` and the gallery's detail view both use it;
`downloadFetchedFile` remains for the copy-to-clipboard path, which genuinely needs the bytes.

#### Fixed: the Salon sidebar's Gallery button appears (bug 129)

It never had. `fetchChatPhotoCount` fetched `/api/v1/chats/{id}?action=files`, and the chat GET does
not dispatch a `files` action — an unrecognised action is not rejected, it falls through to the
whole-chat payload, so the request answered `200`, `data.files` was `undefined`, and the count that
gated the button was zero on every read. The working listing was one path segment away at
`/api/v1/chats/[id]/files`, which the gallery modal itself called correctly once something managed
to open it. The counter is deleted rather than repaired: the number now comes from the chat-gallery
query, and the button has no gate at all. This supersedes step 5 of bug 128, which would have
re-read the same dead action.

#### Fixed: `POST /api/v1/images?action=generate` can be told which chat asked (bug 130)

The route built `linkedTo` from tags alone and had no `chatId` in its schema, so an image made
through it was linked to its tags and to no conversation, and invisible to every
`files.findByLinkedTo(chatId)` read. It now accepts an optional `chatId` and folds it into `linkedTo`
beside the tag ids, deduped so a caller passing both a `CHAT` tag and `chatId` does not link it
twice. Latent rather than live: the Salon's Generate Image dialogs post to
`/api/v1/image-profiles/[id]?action=generate`, which has always passed the chat through, and no
caller in the app used the collection route.
#### Message route trail: every model tried, in order, under the avatar

An assistant message now keeps the route trail — every connection profile tried for the turn, in
the order tried, with why each one stepped aside — and renders it as a list under the avatar,
first tried at the top, the one that answered at the bottom. Before this, the badge showed only
the profile that answered, so a turn the primary timed out on, was rate-limited on, or was
refused on looked exactly like a turn that went through on the first ask.

- **Stored** in a new nullable JSON column `routeTrail` on `chat_messages`
  (`add-route-trail-message-column-v1`). Each entry records the profile's id, name, provider and
  model, how it came to be asked (`primary`, `retry`, `concierge`, `understudy`, `tier-pick`),
  what became of it (`answered`, `failed`, `refused`), the fallback engine's trigger class, how a
  refusal was established (`finish-reason` or `inferred`), and a short reason capped at 200
  characters. `provider` and `modelName` stay authoritative for who answered; the trail's last
  entry always agrees with them.
- **NULL when nothing failed**, which is nearly every message. A one-entry trail would say nothing
  the existing columns already say, and assistant rows are the largest table in the instance. There
  is no backfill: an old message has no trail, and its badge renders exactly as before.
- **Shown** as one row per profile. A row that fell over on its own — timeout, network, auth, rate
  limit, missing model, 5xx, an empty body with no stated reason, no usable API key — is struck
  through and marked ❌. A row the provider refused on content grounds is struck through and marked
  🚫. The row that answered has no mark and no strike, so a single-row trail is
  pixel-identical to the old badge. Hovering a row names the profile, the provider and model, how
  it came to be asked, and what happened. Adjacent rows for the same profile collapse into one
  ("answered on the second try").
- **Rides the `.qtap` export** with the message; `qtap-export.schema.json` carries the shape. An
  imported trail's `profileId` is deliberately not remapped — a stale id in a historical record is
  the truth of what happened, and nothing dereferences it.
- **Theme authors:** the list has no `qt-*` hook of its own yet. Target it through
  `[aria-label="Models tried for this reply"]`.

Mobile has no avatar badge, so it has no trail either. Tool-only turns write no provider
attribution today and get none here.

#### Fixed bug 128: the Salon's memory count went stale and disarmed its own delete button

The sidebar's Delete Memories count was read once, by a mount-only effect, and nothing ever read it
again. Memories are written afterwards by background jobs in the forked child, turn after turn, and
the tabbed workspace keeps a hidden Salon pane mounted for the life of the session — so a chat opened
before its first memory landed read `Delete Memories (0)` indefinitely, over a chat holding dozens.
`handleDeleteChatMemories` then early-returned on that false zero, absorbing the click with no
confirmation, no toast and no log line.

Added a `memories` realtime topic: declared in `realtime.types.ts`, keyed by
`queryKeys.memories.chatCount(chatId)`, mapped in `topic-map.ts` and added to
`ALL_REALTIME_PREFIXES`, and published from `topicsForCompletedJob` for the five memory job types
plus `publishRealtime` at the `memory-gate` deletion chokepoint, which every delete path runs
through. It is the first topic whose `id` is not the changed row's own primary key — it is scoped by `chatId` — which is why `memories` is deliberately
absent from `REPOSITORY_TOPICS`: `firstIdArg` would publish a memory id under a chat-scoped topic and
every subscriber would filter it out.

The subscription lives in `useChatData`, the hook that owns the count, rather than at the Salon call
site, so a future consumer cannot forget it; `useRealtimeTopic` also fires on socket open, so a
reconnect re-reads for free and no poll is added. The count fetch gained `cache: 'no-store'`, matching
its siblings. The button is now `disabled` at zero, and the confirmation re-reads the count from the
server immediately before it opens, so the dialog can never quote a stale number and a socket that was
down does not cost the user the action. Step 5 of the bug's plan (the identical `chatPhotoCount`
shape) stays superseded by the Salon chat gallery plan.

#### Fixed bug 127: the progressions card printed raw markup when two entries were unreadable

`ProgressionsSection` built its list of unreadable progression ids by joining them with a literal
`</code>, <code>` inside a JSX expression. The join produces a string, React escapes it, and the
sentence telling a user their vault is damaged handed them raw markup instead. One bad entry rendered
perfectly — the join had nothing to join — which is why the suite never saw it. The ids are now
rendered as elements, the same map-with-separator shape `CustomToolRunDialog` already uses. Output for
a single id is unchanged character for character.

#### Docs: retired twelve shipped feature specs to `features/complete/`

Moved twelve feature documents from `docs/developer/features/` into
`docs/developer/features/complete/` after verifying each against the code: character
progressions, Pascal custom tools, custom-tool enhancements, custom-tool run presets, the tabbed
workspace, archived scenarios and wardrobe items, the character archive spec and its parent
export-fidelity design, the DB size-reduction spec, the four-tier state cascade, Scriptorium
per-document policy frontmatter, and the Z.AI `reasoning_effort` plan. Relative links inside the
moved files were re-anchored one directory deeper, and inbound references were repointed: 29 source
comments plus `API.md` for the tabbed workspace, `CLAUDE.md`, `PROMPT_ARCHITECTURE.md` and the
update-documentation index for progressions, `bugs.md` and bug 52 for the archive spec, the
quantize-embeddings migration for the DB spec, and the Z.AI plugin test. Two stale status lines were
corrected in place: the Scriptorium policy spec still said "not yet implemented", and the character
archive design still said its surfaces and rehydration remained. Three implemented specs were left
in place because their own completion gates ask for manual verification first: composer smart
typography (two manual matrices), the episodic recall overhaul (constant tuning via
`quilltap recall-replay`), and the Commonplace Book relevance fix (empirical tuning).

#### Docs: plan for the Salon chat gallery

Added `docs/developer/features/salon-chat-gallery.md`, a plan for a Gallery in the Salon sidebar's
Organize drawer that lists every image in a conversation — uploads, tool-generated images,
dialog-generated images, story backgrounds, Aurora avatar repaints, the cast's portraits, images
re-shown from an album, and images referenced in message text — with Save (through the same album
picker the message toolbar's bookmark uses) and Download on each. Covers a single server-side
enumerator, a `?action=gallery` read, a chat-scoped `?action=save-image` twin of the message-scoped
one, `?download=1` on the image routes, a realtime-gated query key, the UI, tests, and help. Records
two defects found while mapping: the sidebar's existing Gallery button never appears because its
count reads a `?action=files` action that does not exist, and images generated from the Generate
Image dialogs are never linked to their chat. Bug 128's step 5 is marked superseded by this plan.
Not yet implemented.

#### Docs: filed bug 128 — the Salon's memory count goes stale and disarms its own delete button

The sidebar's `Delete Memories (n)` count is read once, when the chat mounts, and nothing refreshes
it. Memories are written afterwards by background extraction jobs, so a chat opened before its first
memory exists — which is every new chat — reads `(0)` for as long as the tab stays open. The tabbed
workspace hides an inactive pane with CSS instead of unmounting it, which is what lets a streaming
Salon survive a tab switch and also removes the reload that used to correct the number by accident.
The delete handler then returns early on a count of zero and the button carries no disabled state,
so clicking it does nothing at all: no confirmation, no toast, no log line. Measured on a chat
holding 59 memories that the sidebar reported as none. The filed plan adds a `memories` realtime
topic published from the memory job types, subscribes the sidebar to it, and disables the button at
zero rather than letting it absorb the click. Not yet implemented.

#### Docs: plan for the message route trail

Added `docs/developer/features/message-route-trail.md`, a plan for recording every connection
profile tried for an assistant reply and showing the list under the avatar in the Salon: first
tried at the top, failures struck through and marked with an X emoji when the provider fell over
on its own or with a no-entry emoji when it refused on content grounds, and the answering model
last. Covers the nullable `routeTrail` JSON column on `chat_messages` (NULL when nothing failed),
the single recording chokepoint at the existing failover and Concierge reroute sites, the SSE
`done` payload, rendering, export schema, migration, tests, and help. Not yet implemented.

#### Fixed: a hostname change no longer makes the app shut its own database down (bug 126)

The instance lock's heartbeat checked every 60 seconds whether it still owned the lock by comparing
the recorded hostname against a freshly read `os.hostname()`. On macOS that value is not stable: when
`scutil --get HostName` is unset, which is the default, the system derives the name dynamically and
reports something like `MacBook-Pro.local` at one moment and `Mac` at the next, switching on Wi-Fi
reconnects, sleep/wake, VPN changes and DHCP lease renewals. The heartbeat read the change as another
process taking the database, closed its connections and exited. Under the Electron shell the server
is not restarted, so the window stayed open over a dead backend: the home dashboard rendered nothing
while an already-open Salon tab kept drawing from its cache, which made it look like a UI problem.
Every recorded occurrence logged an identical PID with only the hostname differing.

- Lock ownership is now a snapshot taken when the lock is written — PID plus the acquisition
  timestamp — and the heartbeat compares against that. Both fields are overwritten by any process
  that takes the lock, so a real takeover is still detected immediately. Hostname is a label only.
- Acquisition no longer claims a lock just because the recorded hostname differs. A differing name
  cannot distinguish another machine from this one after a rename, so the decision is made on
  heartbeat freshness for every environment rather than only for Docker. This closes a case where
  two processes on one machine could both open the same database.
- A process whose machine was renamed now releases its own lock on exit instead of leaving a stale
  file behind, and a lock taken by manual override starts a heartbeat.
- The lock-loss shutdown now runs the same ordered teardown as SIGTERM and SIGINT, registered by
  the SQLite client. It previously used a dynamic `require` that did not resolve in the bundled
  standalone server, so it threw instead of closing anything and the WAL was left unmerged.
- `quilltap db --lock-status` no longer reports a running app as `STALE (different host)`, and
  `--lock-clean` refuses to delete a lock whose heartbeat is still being refreshed.

#### Added: character progressions

Characters can now carry progressions: named spans of time with a start, an end, and rules for how
often to report on them. A pregnancy that began on 1 August and is due 1 May; a cannon that takes
ten minutes to recharge; a fermentation that finishes in three weeks. On every prompted turn
Quilltap computes elapsed time, remaining time and percentage from the wall clock and appends a
second-person report to the character's prompt, so the model never has to do the arithmetic or
remember that time has passed.

- Stored under one reserved `progressions` key in the character vault's `metadata.json`. Every
  other key stays freeform. Validated at the point of use rather than at hydration: a malformed
  entry is dropped alone with a warning and the rest survive. Published JSON schema at
  `public/schemas/qtap-progression.schema.json`; no migration.
- Each entry declares the unit its report speaks in (`second` through `year`) and a cadence: every
  turn, whenever the whole-unit count ticks over, or at most once per wall-clock period (`1h`,
  `30s`, `2d`). An entry the user or a tool has just changed reports on the next turn regardless,
  as does one that has just started or finished.
- Spans render as whole units plus a remainder in the next finer unit ("20 weeks, 3 days"). Months
  and years are fixed-length (30.436875 and 365.2425 days), so the arithmetic is deterministic and
  calendar-free.
- Optional per-entry description, quantity (`0.3/1.0 MJ`), and report template with placeholders
  (`{{elapsed}}`, `{{remaining}}`, `{{percent}}`, `{{quantity}}`, and others). An unknown
  placeholder renders as written.
- The report is a trailing per-turn section, after Suparṇā's mail and before the turn-skip note.
  It never enters the cached system block, so prompt caching is unaffected and no builder version
  is bumped. It is not persisted as a message. The greeting builder and Carina both append a forced
  report; continue turns skip it.
- Cadence is derived from the character's own last turn in the chat rather than stored, so the
  prompt path performs no writes. A character who is prompted but does not speak can hear a
  period-cadence entry once more inside the same period; this is documented.
- Pascal custom tools gain a `progress` read subject (`when.progress`, availability gates) keyed
  `"<id>.<field>"`, `{{progress.<id>.<field>}}` and `{{now}}` placeholders, and
  `progress.<id>.<field>` effect targets. A tool can be withheld until a recharge completes and
  re-arm it on a successful roll with `{{now}}` and `{{now}} + 600000`. Writing to an unknown id
  creates the progression; `remove` deletes one. Progress writes fold into the existing single
  character metadata write. A result the schema refuses is rolled back and the roll still stands.
- `metadata.progressions` and `metadata.progressions.*` are refused as effect
  targets when a tool file loads. An effect writes a primitive, so the former
  would replace the whole reserved object with a string, bypassing the
  progressions validation and rollback; the latter would write a literal key
  named `progressions.cannon` and touch no progression.
- The model cannot set its own progression: there is no LLM tool for it, and the `state` tool has
  no access. Only the user and Pascal's server-side effects write them.
- New Progressions card on the Aurora character edit page (System Prompts tab) with an editor for
  each entry and a live preview of the line the character will read. Archived characters are
  read-only.
- Pascal's Workbench gains the `progress` condition subject, the `progress.` effect-target prefix,
  the `{{now}}` and `{{progress.…}}` insert options, and a live list of what a hand-typed fact
  sheet's progressions derive to.

#### Docs: plan for character progressions

Added `docs/developer/features/character-progressions.md`: a plan for timed, in-progress
character properties (a pregnancy with a due date, a weapon recharging over ten minutes). Each one
is stored under a reserved `progressions` key in the vault's `metadata.json` with a published JSON
schema, and on every prompted turn the character is told elapsed time, remaining time and percent
complete, deterministically, in the unit and at the cadence the entry declares. The report lives in
the uncached per-turn tail of the prompt, never in the cached system block. Pascal custom tools gain
a `progress.<id>.<field>` read subject and gate, a `{{now}}` reference, and `progress.*` effect
targets so a roll can re-arm a countdown. Includes an Aurora editor card and a phased task list.
No code changes yet.

#### Added: character subprompts

Characters can now carry subprompts: short, optional instructions stored as Markdown files in
the vault's root-level `Subprompts/` folder (frontmatter `title`, body = the instruction, written
in the second person like a system prompt). The folder is created on the first write; a missing
folder lists as empty.

- Which subprompts are in play is stored per seat on the chat (`participants[].selectedSubpromptIds`).
  Pick them from a Subprompts dropdown under each character's system-prompt selector in the New Chat
  dialog, and from the same dropdown on the participant card in the Salon's Participants drawer.
  Every dropdown offers "New subprompt…", which opens the Lexical editor in place and ticks the new
  one on.
- Manage them on the Aurora System Prompts tab, beneath the primary prompts. The AI Wizard and
  Character Optimizer leave subprompts alone.
- Selected subprompts render in the compiled identity stack directly after the system prompt as an
  `## Additional Instructions` block, and in the greeting. Changing the selection recompiles the
  seat's cached stack; editing a subprompt recompiles every chat carrying it; deleting one strips it
  from those seats first. A seat with none selected produces a byte-identical prompt, so no builder
  version bump.
- A character dressing themselves in the green room sees the selected subprompts alongside their
  dressing instructions.
- New routes: `GET/POST /api/v1/characters/[id]/subprompts`,
  `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/characters/[id]/subprompts/[subpromptId]`.

### 4.9.2

#### Fixed: a help chat's tool results now reach the model on every provider (bug 124)

Asking the Help dialog something the character had to look up ("Where do I change the theme? Take me
there.") produced nothing on OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Grok, Ollama, DeepSeek, NanoGPT and Z.AI
seats. The help chat's own agent loop sent tool results back as `tool` messages with no call id and
an assistant turn with no tool calls attached. Every provider plugin except Google drops a tool row
it cannot pair, so the model never saw its search results, searched again, and the repeated-call
guard ended the turn with an empty reply. Google seats answered because that plugin keeps an
unpaired row.

- The help loop now builds its assistant turn and tool rows through the same threading helpers the
  Salon and the Brahma Console use. A result with a provider call id is paired to its call; one
  without (the text-block tool path) is framed as `[Tool Result: <name>]` user text.
- The stuck-loop reminder now uses the last result directly instead of searching the message list
  by role.
- Two regression tests drive one native tool turn through the help loop and check the messages
  the follow-up request receives.

#### Fixed: Google no longer rejects a tool-enabled turn whose tool slate includes the wardrobe tools (bug 125)

A Gemini profile with tool use on, in a help chat or in any chat whose character has a wardrobe,
failed every turn with `Invalid JSON payload received. Unknown name "additionalProperties" at
'...parameters.properties[0].value.items'`. The Google plugin strips JSON Schema fields Google's
function-calling API does not accept, but `additionalProperties` was not on the list. The top-level
one never reached the wire, while the one under the wardrobe tools' `operations` array items did.

- `additionalProperties` is now stripped at every depth. Google plugin 1.1.51.
- A regression test runs the real `wardrobe_wear` and `wardrobe_take_off` schemas through the
  sanitizer. Loading the plugin under Jest needed a manual mock for the ESM-only `@google/genai` SDK.

### 4.9.1

#### Fixed: a paused chat no longer goes quiet without saying so, and Skip is always offered (bug 123)

When a chained character turn failed (a provider error that exhausted the fallback chain), the server
paused the chat as a safety stop. The Salon learned of the first pause and showed Resume, but not of a
second one a few minutes later: the client only re-read the pause flag when the fetched value changed,
and pressing Resume had changed the local flag without updating the fetched copy. The fetched value went
from paused to paused, nothing fired, and the client believed the chat was live while the server held it
paused. Every message then drew exactly one reply, nudges worked but chained nowhere, and the sidebar
read "Pause" throughout. A reload was the only fix.

- The client now reconciles its pause flag with the server's on every fetch, and Pause/Resume update
  the fetched chat object too.
- A turn chain that stops because the chat is paused now emits a `paused` chain-complete event and
  logs, instead of returning silently. Every chain-complete carries a `paused` flag; the chain-error
  safety stop sets it, an empty-response stop does not.
- The Salon shows a toast when a chain stops on a pause the user did not cause, with specific wording
  when a character's turn failed. All-LLM rooms keep their existing pause dialog instead.
- The Skip button is offered whenever the composer will accept a message as a character you control,
  your own or one you are impersonating, not only when the rotation has formally landed on that seat.
  The banner wording says whose turn it is. Skipping an impersonated seat now works from the client
  (the server already allowed it), and skipping lifts a pause first, as nudging does. The must-speak
  guard is unchanged.
